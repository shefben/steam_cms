  <br>
We've seen an increase lately in the number of unscrupulous people acquiring Steam accounts (and access to Steam games) by stealing them from other users. These people accomplish their theft by simply asking legitimate users for their login information. This practice is known as "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing">Phishing</a>," and is found to some extent in nearly all online account-based systems.<br>
<br>
By posing as a Steam official in an email message, or sometimes by pretending to be a helpful user who wants to "trade" one account for another, the thieves are often able to convince people to divulge their user name and password.<br>
<br>
We know how frustrating it is to have your account stolen. As much as we can, we want to put a stop to this practice. To do that, we need your help -- please keep the following in mind:<br>
<br>
<blockquote><strong>Your Steam ID and password are confidential information. A Valve employee will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or email message. Do not respond to any message that asks for your password. Here is some <a href="http://steampowered.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/steampowered.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=301">more information about protecting your account</a>.</strong></blockquote><br>
In the meantime, happy gaming.<br>
