<h1>Friday, November 17 2006</h1>
<br>
If you haven't checked out <a href="steam://store/4700">Medieval II: Total War</a>, you can still get in on the just-released frenzy. Nothing like a bloody quest to become the master of Europe to spice up your weekend.<br>
<hr>
The Steam Hardware Survey was updated this week, which means we've begun collecting new data from Steam users about their computers. You can <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.steampowered.com/status/survey.html">check out the survey results</a> & compare your own rig to the community at large.<br>
<hr>
New Valve Anti-Cheat technology caught a few people cheating in Counter-Strike: Source and other games this week -- over 10,000. VAC detects anyone using cheat software and permanently bans their Steam account. We expect to see a surge of forum posts laying blame squarely at the feet of "my little brother."<br>
<hr>
Coming to Steam next week: <a href="steam://store/4230">RACE</a> The WTCC Game (which you can pre-purchase now for 10% off). Also, a new single-player version of <a href="steam://store/2400">The Ship</a> will be available on November 20th.<br>
