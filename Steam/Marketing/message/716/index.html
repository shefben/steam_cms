With the 5-day <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.steampowered.com/index.php?area=roFreeWeekend">Red Orchestra free trial</a> now in full swing, we hope everyone will get a chance to get in and see what this game is all about over the weekend. It is completely free to try out until this coming Monday, so give it a try and see if it is the kind of game for you.<br clear="all">
<hr>
<img style="margin-right:12px;" align="left" src="img/leipzig_logo.jpg">Here at Valve we're all working around the clock to get all of the pieces of Episode Two ready to show at the <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.gc-germany.com/presse_e.shtml">Leipzig Games Convention</a>. We're looking forward to showing off Episode Two, Team Fortress 2, and Portal to everyone at the show. If you're planning on being near Leipzig, Germany in late August, feel free to drop by our area and take a look.<br>
