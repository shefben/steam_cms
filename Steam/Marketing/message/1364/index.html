Hit indie developer Introversion Software just delivered an early holiday gift: three of its award-winning games bundled in one low-priced collection, appropriately titled <a href="steam://openurl/http://steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=package&SubId=578">The Introversion Anthology</a>. Packing three cult classic games—Uplink, DEFCON, and Darwinia—the collection is now on Steam for &#36;29.95 with an extra $10 off for one week only. These games deserve all the accolades showered on them—don’t pass it up!<br>

<a href="steam://openurl/http://www.steampowered.com/status/tf2/tf2_stats.php">Team Fortress 2 gameplay stats</a> are now live. We track detailed game data to help you learn how the community is playing the game and helps us make any tweaks necessary to ensure a fun, balanced experience. Check out which Team Fortress 2 class is most played, the average time per round for each map and even precisely where on each map players die most often. These stats and many more are updated weekly.<br>
<br>
<a href="steam://openurl/http://store.valvesoftware.com/">The Valve Store</a> is stocked with new items: Aperture Laboratories coffee mugs and posters, Weighted Companion Cube plushes and ready-to-hang fuzzies, and--back by popular demand--Half-Life 2 Headcrab Hats and Headcrab plushes.
