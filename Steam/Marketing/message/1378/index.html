We released the original soundtrack to The Orange Box today. Featuring 19 original compositions, the musical odyssey spans every shade of Orange: the troop-rallying anthems of Team Fortress 2, the textural soundworlds of Half-Life 2: Episodes One and Two; and the atmospheric electronica from Portal's test chambers. As a special bonus, the soundtrack includes two versions of Jonathan Coulton’s “Still Alive”: the in-game version and Coulton’s vocal mix, an exclusive track unavailable anywhere else.<br>
<br>
The CD soundtrack is now available at <a href="steam://openurl/http://store.valvesoftware.com">the Valve Store</a>. The digital version is headed to iTunes, Napster, eMusic, Amazon MP3 and other digital music services in the coming weeks.<br>
