We're now in the home stretch on getting everything finished off with the Orange Box games. Just this week, we've finished recording and placing all of the developer commentary for the three new games. Episode Two, Team Fortress 2, and Portal together will include over two and a half hours of new commentary that should help shed some light into the thinking and challenges behind these three new games. This is all in addition to the hour or so of commentary included in Episode One. Commentary will be included on all three platforms (PC, XBOX 360, and PS3). <a href="steam://openurl/http://storefront.steampowered.com/Steam/Marketing/message/1125/MerleDandridgeOnBeingAlyx.mp3">Here's Merle Dandridge, the voice of Alyx, talking about Alyx</a>.<br>

Two of our artists were recently honored by being selected as part of the Into the Pixel art collection. The collection will be publicly shown at the E for All exhibition at the LA Convention Center from October 18-21, 2007. Here are the two pieces of concept art from Jeff Ballinger (Farm from TF2) and Jeremy Bennett (City 17 from EP2).<br>
