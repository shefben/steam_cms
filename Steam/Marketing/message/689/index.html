The first surprise is a new game called Portal which is best described by the video coming out next week. The second big surprise is that <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.steampowered.com/Steam/Marketing/message/689/img/Team_Fortress_2.jpg">Team Fortress 2</a> will be included with Episode Two. Look for that video next week as well. And the final surprise is that all of these are coming out for PC, Xbox 360 and the PS3.<br>

<img align="left" src="img/TheShip.gif">A big congratulations to Outerlight for releasing <a href="steam://store/2400">The Ship</a> this week via Steam. The Ship is a unique multiplayer game built using Source, set on a series of luxury, art deco cruise ships and challenges you to kill or be killed. Once you're onboard you're given the name of another passenger whom you must find and secretly murder. It quite a bit different (and quite fun) than any other multiplayer game you have played or seen. <br>
