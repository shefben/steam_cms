A couple of weeks ago here at Valve we hosted Charles Onyett from IGN for <a href="steam://openurl/http://pc.ign.com/articles/760/760290p1.html">a hands-on preview of Turtlerock's upcoming co-op game Left 4 Dead</a>. This is the first time we've had someone outside of either Turtlerock or Valve play the game and talk about it publicly, so if you want to see what his first impression was of what he played, head over to his write-up.<br clear="all">
