Dark Messiah of Might and Magic is coming to Steam. This week we made <a href="steam://store/2100">the single player demo</a> available to everyone. Try out the demo and find out what "Action RPG" really means&mdash;the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e combat and spellcasting are a blast.<br>
<hr>
<a href="steam://store/937">The fifth of five new gameplay movies</a> from Half-Life 2: Episode Two is now available. This week's release of movies concludes with a look at the expansive outdoor environments, new creatures, and weapons included in Episode Two&mdash;including a brand new way to take down striders. Targeted for release in Q1 2007 on the PC, Xbox 360 and Playstation 3, Half-Life 2: Episode Two will also include Team Fortress 2 and Portal.<br>
<hr>
The changes coming to the Counter-Strike: Source weapon and equipment economy are still underway, but we're not quite ready to announce exactly what we have planned. The scope of the change involves changing the prices of every item in the game&mdash;some more significantly than others. But that's just the beginning. We'll have more info on what's in store, soon.<br>
