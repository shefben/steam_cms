<h1>Friday, December 22nd 2006</h1>
<br>
It was a busy and windy week here at Valve. As most of the community knows by now, last week a major windstorm hit the greater Seattle area. Power outages are fairly common in the area, but the magnitude of this storm knocked out our datacenter, resulting in about 20 hours Steam interruption. This was very frustrating for everyone here and we know it was frustrating for you as well. We learned a lot and are taking steps to make sure that when the next storm like this hits our area 15-20 years from now *fingers crossed*, people will still be playing games on Steam while we are buying flashlight batteries.<br>
<br>
Four indie games came to Steam last week: <a href="steam://store/4900">Zen of Sudoku</a> (by Charlie Cleveland of <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.unknownworlds.com/ns/">Natural Selection</a> fame), <a href="steam://store/4600">Full Pipe</a>, <a href="steam://store/2520">Gumboy Crazy Adventures</a>, and <a href="steam://store/6100">Eets</a>. They're interesting detours from the beaten path. Check them out while they have an extra 10% off their release price. In other indie news, <a href="steam://store/2400">The Ship</a> is having a free weekend starting today.<br>
<br>
Empire Interactive brought three games to Steam as well: <a href="steam://store/2990">Flat Out 2</a>, <a href="steam://store/6200">Ghost Master</a>, and <a href="steam://store/6210">Vegas-Make It Big</a>. To celebrate the holidays, the entire catalog of Strategy First and Empire Interactive games are 20% off.<br>
<br>
Lastly, Ubisoft is offering 30% off <a href="steam://store/2100">Dark Messiah</a> in North America. Gamespy awarded <a href="steam://store/380">Half-Life 2: Episode One</a> Game of the Year in PC Action and to celebrate we are offering 20% off on Episode One and every package in which it is included.<br>
<br>
*Whew*. . .time for some egg nog. Happy holidays.
