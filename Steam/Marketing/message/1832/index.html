We've mentioned that <a href="steam://store/17330">Crysis Warhead</a> is available on Steam, but you may not have noticed the new multiplayer experience that's included with Warhead, called Crysis Wars. It's essentially a stand-alone multiplayer game in its own right, which is included when you purchase Crysis Warhead. It's got 7 new maps and plenty of vehicle-based combat. Here at Valve, we're a little too wrapped up with putting the finishing touches on Left 4 Dead to play much of anything else, but we're hearing from customers that Crysis Wars has lots of variety and is definitely worth checking out. There's a brief <a href="steam://store/5086">HD trailer for Crysis Wars</a> on Steam. If you haven't checked out the <a href="steam://store/5083">Crysis Warhead trailer</a>, be sure to give that one a look too.<br>
