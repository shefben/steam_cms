<h1>Friday, November 10 2006</h1>

<br>
This week on Steam we had the debut of the Unreal 3 powered <a href="steam://store/4300">Roboblitz</a>, a humorous game where you play as a robot (named Blitz) who has to use a number of gadgets and gizmos to get a Space Cannon up and running. We've also seen significant updates to both <a href=steam://store/2100>Dark Messiah</a> and <a href=steam://store/2810>X3 Reunion</a> released.
<hr>
A new item has been added to the Valve merchandise store for fans of our beloved robot D0G. For about 10 dollars you can get a 28.5" x 16" poster of him squaring off against a Strider in Episode Two. Click <a href="steam://openurl/http://store.valvesoftware.com/productpages/prints/product_HL2EP2Poster.html">here</a> to check it out.

<hr>
We'll be showing off what the retail box will be looking like on MTV's gaming show G-Hole next Wednesday the 15th at 8:00 p.m. This will include three short videos from Episode Two, Team Fortress 2, and Portal.<br>
