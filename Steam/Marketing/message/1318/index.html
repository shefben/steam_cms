<br>
Every few months, we like to find out what kinds of hardware people in the community are using. This is incredibly useful to us as game developers in that it ensures that we're making good decisions about what kinds of technology investments to make as well as giving the community a page to compare their current hardware setup to.<br>
<br>
Earlier this week, we reset the Steam Hardware Survey. The first 135,000 responses offer a preview of the latest hardware trends amongst Steam users.<br>
<ul>
    <li>40% of your systems have 2GB or more system RAM on board.</li>
    <li>Just over 7% of respondents can run a DX10 path for graphics.</li>
    <li>About 40% of your PCs are running with multiple CPU cores.</li>
    <li>Most of your systems are equipped with an NVIDIA GeForce video card.</li>
    <li>Windows Vista is the OS of choice for 14% of you. </li>
</ul>
Check out <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.steampowered.com/status/survey.html">the rest of the survey data</a> to see the full picture, or take a look at <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.steampowered.com/status/survey_v6.html">the previous survey results</a> to see where we were a few months back.<br>
<hr>
We also launched the <a href="steam://openurl/http://steampowered.com/status/ep2/ep2_stats.php">Half-Life 2: Episode Two stats page</a> this week. Compare your playing experience with the rest of the world: stats include average completion time, total play time, and new death maps, a visual overview of where players died most often in each map.<br>
<hr>
