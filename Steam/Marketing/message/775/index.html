<h1>Friday, October 6 2006</h1>
<br>

Starting on Wednesday of next week we'll be starting a beta of the new Counter-Strike weapons market that we first announced <a href="steam://openurl/http://storefront.steampowered.com/Steam/Marketing/message/768/">here</a>. The beta will give us some real-world data to start the market going, along with making sure that any issues get fixed before we roll this out to the entire community. Information on how to join the beta should show up on most of the major Counter-Strike news sites.
<hr>
Dark Messiah: Might and Magic is now available for <a href="steam://store/2100">preload and prepurchase</a>. Dark Messiah is a big game (approx. 10 GB), so starting the preload now will make it faster to begin playing when it is released.
<hr>
Increasing our catalog of casual games, <a href="steam://store/4100">Poker Superstars II</a> debuted on Steam this week. You can play the free trial on Steam now. Purchase during the first week and save &#36;5.00. Additionally, <a href="steam://store/3330">Zuma</a>, one of our Pop-Cap games, is now available for &#36;9.95, as well as a free trial.
