Our own Gabe Newell demoed never-before-seen content from Half-Life 2: Episode 2 and Portal on Dell’s newest high-performance gaming notebook, the <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.dell.com/beast">XPS M1730</a>, and debuted a new Orange Box ad coming soon to major TV networks&#8212;stay tuned. In and around the show, "Alyx" look-alikes <a href="steam://openurl/http://storefront.steampowered.com/Steam/Marketing/message/1223/img/alyxLookAlike.jpg"><img style="position:relative;top:3px;" src="img/tinyAlyx.jpg"></a> invited folks to play Team Fortress 2 at Dell's mobile gaming bus, which will be stationed at the show through September 30 and on tour in the US&#8212;with TF2 riding "shotgun" through the holidays.<br>

Next week, over 700 players from 75 countries (along with an expected 70,000 attendees) will gather in Seattle for the <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.worldcybergames.com/6th/2007/GrandFinal/ticket.asp">World Cyber Games</a>, one of the world's most prominent professional gaming competitions.
