If you're looking for a real sandbox game (and who isn't?) look no further than the recently released <a href="steam://store/4000">Garry's MOD 10</a>. The eponymous Garry Newman has been building this modification and releasing updates since Half-Life 2 was originally released. As with the early days of Counter-Strike, a pretty large community has begun following it. <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.youtube.com/results?search_type=search_videos&search_query=gmod&search_sort=video_view_count&search_category=0">Check out some movies of Garry's MOD on YouTube</a> -- they tend to generate a lot of interest.</div>
