<br>
Yesterday we released the Summer 2006 Update for <a href="steam://store/300">Day of Defeat: Source</a>. Judging from the games we've had on the public servers running the new maps, <a href="steam://store/917">Jagd</a> and <a href="steam://store/918">Colmar</a> (click each to see trailers), people are having the same kind of fun we were having around the office before we released them. If you still haven't purchased Day of Defeat: Source, you'll get a chance to play the new maps in about a week, as we'll be having a second Day of Defeat: Source Free Weekend. The second free weekend will commence at 1:00 p.m. Pacific time on July 7th, and conclude at 1:00 p.m Pacific time on July 10th. We're looking forward to seeing you all there.<br>
<hr>
Meanwhile, Ritual has also updated <a href="steam://store/1300">SiN Episodes: Emergence</a> with a completely new game mode called Arena. This game mode utilizes Ritual's Personal Challenge System to tailor an experience unique to each player's play style. It also has a built in feature that will record a demo of you playing in Arena mode that you'll be able to share with your friends to compare high scores.<br>
<hr>
We've got a lot going on here at Valve, not the least of which is working on Episode Two. Look for more news on that front, along with a few other announcements, in the next few weeks.<br>
