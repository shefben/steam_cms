<a href="steam://openurl/http://www.steamgames.com/v/index.php?area=game&AppId=90043">Insurgency: Modern Infantry Combat</a> is a squad-based, multiplayer total conversion for Half-Life 2. Insurgency simulates modern infantry combat and encourages the use of teamwork and tactics to take down the enemy. The team updated their BETA 2 with a new commander promotion system, new classes, and a new night map (Ins_Samawah). <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.steamgames.com/v/index.php?area=game&AppId=5011">Check out their new trailer</a>.<br>

<a href="steam://openurl/http://www.empiresmod.com/"><img align="left" style="margin:3px 16px 16px 0px;" src="img/EmpiresTanks_t.jpg"></a>The <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.empiresmod.com/">Empires</a> team has released the second version of their Half-Life 2 mod, which combines real-time strategy and first person shooter genres. Each game team has four classes to choose from (scout, rifleman, grenadier, and engineer), each with unique weapons and skills. One person from each team becomes the Commander and leads his team to victory using an RTS-like game interface and an adjustable top-down view of the battlefield. <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.gametrailers.com/player/27999.html">Watch the trailer over here</a>.<br>
