<p><h1>Friday, May 4, 2006</h1>
<br>
<img align="left" src="img/Alyx.gif" style="margin-right:4px;margin-top:4px;">Right now, we're in the midst of those very busy days we alluded to a few weeks ago. The preload for <a href="steam://preload/380">Episode One</a> started Monday. The team is working day and night, putting the finishing touches on our first Episodic release. And we'll be adding more content to what is being preloaded next week to insure that everyone has everything they need to play come June 1st.<br>

<br>
You also may have noticed there is a new tab in Steam, named <a href="steam://open/mymedia">My Media</a>. It currently includes a number of movies from both Valve and third parties, and we'll be building more into that area over time. <br>

<br>
Next week there will be two new games made available for play. The first is <a href="http://storefront.steampowered.com/v2/index.php?area=game&AppId=2500" target="_blank">Shadowgrounds</a>, which is currently offered with a 20% discount if you pre-purchase the game before it launches on Monday. Then on Wednesday, the first <a href="http://storefront.steampowered.com/v2/index.php?area=game&AppId=1300" target="_blank">Sin Episode</a> will be unlocked and ready for play.
