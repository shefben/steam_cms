We raised hell on Steam this week with games that'll keep you on the edge of&#8212;or under&#8212;your seat.<br>
<ul>
<li><a href="steam://openurl/http://www.steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=game&AppId=11420">Clive Barker's Jericho</a> is a new squad-based supernatural horror FPS.</li>
<li>If evil-doing is more your style, <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=game&AppId=11450">Overlord</a> invites you to control a horde of minions as you pillage lands and conquer kingdoms. It's good, unclean, despotic fun.</li>
<li>And just in time for Halloween, <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=agegate&AppId=2600">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines</a> is 50% off.</li>
<li>Last, there's just a few days left to preorder <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=game&AppId=3270">Painkiller: Overdose</a>, the new prequel to Painkiller.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
We just stocked the Team Fortress 2 aisle of the Valve store with <a href="steam://openurl/http://store.valvesoftware.com">a collection of new posters</a>.<br>

<hr>
The first post-Orange release of the Source SDK is being made ready for release. This release will allow Mod authors to create custom maps and additional content for Episode Two, Team Fortress 2, and Portal. A follow-up release to allow Mod authors to create custom Mods based upon the Episode Two client and server code will be next. <br>
