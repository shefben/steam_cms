We're at the beginning of our <a href="steam://openurl/http://storefront.steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=fw_race">free weekend for RACE</a>. Until this Thursday the 25th, RACE is also 10% off the regular price of &#36;29.95. Not only does it have a single player series to play through, but it also has multiplayer mode for up to 24 players. Have fun. Get ready for some great wheel-to-wheel racing in some of the fastest production based race cars from BMW, Honda, Chevrolet, and others. A steering wheel is recommended, and you can purchase one of those from us as well over at <a href="steam://openurl/http://store.valvesoftware.com/">the Valve store</a>.<br>
