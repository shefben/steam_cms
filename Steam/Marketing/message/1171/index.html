Valve was at the Leipzig Games Convention in Germany this week showcasing Half-Life 2: Episode 2, Team Fortress 2, and Portal. At the show, we debuted the second Team Fortress 2 character movie, "<a href="steam://openurl/http://www.steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=game&AppId=985">Meet the Soldier</a>," now showing on Steam.<br>
<hr>
Introversion is hosting a DEFCON freeplay weekend in conjunction with the Penny Arcade Expo, the annual gamer festival held in our hometown, Seattle. You’re invited to take part: simply <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=game&AppId=1522">download the free trial version here</a>. From Friday, August 24th at 18:00 GMT and until Monday, August 27th at 06:00 GMT, the usual demo restrictions will be lifted and you'll have access to the full game.<br>
<hr>
Also, here's the historical fact-of-the-day: it was exactly eleven years ago that Valve was born. We're singing Happy Birthday to ourselves this week as we put the finishing touches on the Orange Box. Feel free to sing along and eat cake.<br>
