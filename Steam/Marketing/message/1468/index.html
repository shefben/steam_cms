Since its release two weeks ago, <a href="steam://store/12900">Audiosurf</a> has taken the world by storm. Hats off to Dylan Fitterer, the game’s creator, for making a fun, addictive game that has all of us digging through our music collections for new music and old favorites to "ride." The critics are raving as well: <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.gamesradar.com/pc/audiosurf/review/audiosurf/a-2008022816464281009/g-20080228162145956077">GamesRadar</a> claims Audiosurf offers "a near-religious musical gaming experience," <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3166687">1UP</a> calls it "the best possible excuse to rediscover your CD/MP3 collection," and <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.bit-tech.net/gaming/2008/02/26/audiosurf/1">Bit-tech.net</a> states "Audiosurf is not just another music game – it’s the logical extension of all music games, wrapped up and tailored especially for the best of all platforms, the PC."<br>

The Half-Life 2 mod <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.pvkii.com/">Pirates, Vikings, and Knights II</a> received lots of praise when it unleashed its polished, fast-paced multiplayer game modes. The team just released its beta 2.0 release, which features an improved melee combat system, new maps, and new classes to play—including the peg-legged Pirate Captain, who’s parrot doubles as one of most unique support classes we’ve seen in some time.<br>
