<h1>Friday, August 18 2006</h1>
<br>
Today we released an update for Day of Defeat: Source that addresses a number of issues people were having with the game. Details of this release are available <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.steampowered.com/index.php?area=news&id=724">here</a>.<br>
<hr>
Next week we'll have another Counter-Strike: Source release, where we'll be unveiling the new radar that was first mentioned <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.steampowered.com/Steam/Marketing/message/718/">here</a>. We're looking forward to seeing how people like it, along with how it will change gameplay. Looking beyond this release, we'll be taking a look at the economy of Counter-Strike and how we're pricing weapons.<br>
<hr>
Around Valve these days, the Leipzig Games Convention is the focus of everyone working on Episode Two, Team Fortress 2, and Portal. Coming out of next week we'll be releasing some of the new footage for everyone to see.<br>
