Earlier this week, we reset the <b>Steam Hardware Survey</b> so we can keep on top of what kind of hardware everyone out there is running. So far, we've received over 200,000 responses. Thanks to everyone for sharing your information. Some of the highlights so far:<br>
<ul>
<li>Just over 1% of respondents can run a DX10 path for graphics.</li>
<li>About 78% of you have microphones plugged in for voice communication. This will help you out a lot in TF2.</li>
<li>A little under 5% of you have upgraded to Vista.</li>
<li>Around 20% of your PCs are running multiple CPU cores.</li>
</ul>
<a href="steam://openurl/http://www.steampowered.com/status/survey.html">Check out the rest of the survey data here</a>. Note: Results are added as they are received.<br>
<hr>
<img align="left" style="margin:4px 12px 4px 0px;" src="img/redorchestra.gif">Big news for <b>Red Orchestra</b> this week. Tripwire released a major free update, including 10 new maps, increased player limits, and tons of new content. To usher in the extensive update, Red Orchestra is 20% off list price for a limited time, plus new and current owners can hand out two Steam Guest Passes that enable 10 days of free play for friends.
