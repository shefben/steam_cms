	<h1>Friday, May 19th 2006</h1><br>
	<a href="steam://store/380">Episode One</a> is set for release June 1st via Steam and at retail outlets around the world. As we approach the 
	launch of our first episodic release, we will be releasing a series of short gameplay clips that will focus, 
	like Episode One, on Alyx. You will find these shorts in the new <a href="steam://open/mymedia">My Media</a> 
	area of Steam.<br>
	<br>
	One of the many Source MODs we've been keeping our eye on is <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.nuclear-dawn.net">Nuclear Dawn</a>, and 
	apparently some of the more popular game publications have taken notice as well. Computer Gaming World and PC Zone have both recently 
	featured the class based post-apocalyptic FPS/RTS hybrid in their magazines, and we wanted to make sure the community had all taken a 
	look at what they are building.
	<br>
	<br>
	Finally <a href="steam://store/1300">Sin Episodes: Emergence</a>, which shipped to North American retailers and via Steam on May 10th, will be available 
	at retail outlets in Western Europe next week. Check your local stores for more information.
