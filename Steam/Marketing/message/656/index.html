One of the by-products of moving the Half-Life story forward in episodic form is that the community has lots of interesting things to talk, argue, and make guesses about between installments. There have been many unofficial attempts to chronicle the story's various questions and answers, and two of them have recently caught our eye here at Valve. They are Chan "Ventro" K's <a href="steam://openurl/http://members.shaw.ca/halflifestory/">Half-Life Saga Story Guide</a> and the <a href="steam://openurl/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_2:_Episode_One">Wikipedia Episode One page</a>. Note that these pages feature key story elements from Episode One, so we wouldn't recommend reading them until after you've played through the game.<br>

The next big update coming to our multiplayer games will include two completely new maps for Day of Defeat: Source, named Colmar and Jagd. (Long-time Day of Defeat players will recognize the name Jagd, but the name is really all the new map shares with its predecessor.) Both maps will have slightly differing takes on a new gameplay style we're calling "Detonation". Both will be released on the 28th of June, along with other updates to the game itself. <br>
