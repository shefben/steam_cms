Team Fortress 2 is really moving along in development. In fact, things have reached a point where people start getting pretty antsy around the office as we get closer and closer to the 6:00 p.m. playtest session. We will be sharing more information about TF2 over the next couple of months, and we'll make sure to point that out to people here. We've included an illustration of some of the TF2 characters here that is currently being used for the start-up screen for the game.<br>
