	<h1>Friday, September 7 2007</h1>
<br>
You've met the <a href="steam://store/960">Heavy</a>, You've met the <a href="steam://store/985">Soldier</a>. In a few short days you'll be able to meet the Engineer, the third character to introduce himself from Team Fortress 2. The high-definition movie will be posted on Steam early next week.<br>
<br>
While the Heavy considers bullets-per-minute the measure of a man, and the Soldier values an unusually deep knowledge of military philosophy, the Engineer is content to solve problems. Practical problems. Click the thumbnails for a sneak peek.<br>

In other TF2 news, stay tuned for a pretty big announcement next week. You're going to want to hold off on planning any vacations until you hear what we've got to say on Tuesday.<br>
