New achievement packs will be added to Team Fortress 2 in the coming weeks. First up: a batch of 36 achievements for all the hard-working medics out there. Here's a sneak peek:<br>

<hr>
We usher in the holiday season with new merch in the Valve company store...<br>
<br>
We’re pleased to offer <a href="steam://openurl/http://store.valvesoftware.com">three new lithographs</a> in our collector's edition prints. Each of the lithographs features concept art from Orange Box games—Portal, Half-Life 2: Episode 2, and Team Fortress 2. The first hundred of these limited-edition runs are hand-signed and numbered by the artist and embossed with the Valve lambda.<br>
<br>
If Portal’s Weighted Companion Cube and cake could express holiday cheer—and we remind you that they cannot—they’d send an Aperture Laboratory Holiday Greeting Card. This limited-edition pack includes 15 <a href="steam://openurl/http://store.valvesoftware.com/productpages/accessories/product_ApLabsHolidayCard.html">Portal-themed greeting cards</a>—three each of five different sets, each with a unique holiday greeting inside. Slip in a new <a href="steam://openurl/http://store.valvesoftware.com">Aperture Laboratories parking sticker</a>, available separately, to warm the heart of your favorite Portal jumper.<br>
<br>
Also in stock for the holidays: The Orange Box gift certificate pack. You get two gift certificates for the Orange Box, each presented in an Aperture Laboratory Holiday Greeting Card. As a bonus, the gift certificates save you 10% off the regular retail price.<br>
<hr>
You can pick up Activision’s action-adventure game <a href="steam://store/2610">GUN</a> for just &#36;9.95 USD, a 50% savings, this weekend only. Saddle up.<br>
