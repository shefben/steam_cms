Today's an exciting day for us at Valve. As Steam has grown over the past few years, we've been proud to bring a catalog of games to the community that we consider great. Today, we are especially happy to be able to deliver the games and franchises that have been among the most inspiring to us personally as game developers. Ten years ago, it was DOOM, QUAKE, Wolfenstein, Heretic, Hexen, and even Commander Keen that the founders of Valve discussed most often as benchmarks in our industry. At that time, Valve even licensed the QUAKE engine to build its first game.<br>
<br>
Today at QuakeCon, <a href="steam://openurl/http://steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=news&id=1141">id announced</a> that <a href="steam://openurl/http://storefront.steampowered.com/v/index.php?publisher=id">its catalog</a> is now available on Steam, making it easy for people around the world to play these legendary games. For super-fans, there's even a way to buy <a href="steam://openurl/http://storefront.steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=package&SubId=440">the whole list at once</a> for an amazing price.<br>
<br>
This weekend, we'll be taking a (short!) break from building The Orange Box games to hang out in QUAKE'S DM3. See you there.<br>
