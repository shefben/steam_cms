		<h1>Friday, April 29 2005</h1>
		<br>
		This week we're going to be talking about some Source-based projects from folks other than Valve.<br>
		<br>
		The team over at <a href="http://www.planofattackgame.com/">Plan of Attack</a> released the first 
		version of their game, which focuses on strategic team game play, where the players on each team 
		are presented decisions at the start of each round that impact the flow of the game. Here at Valve 
		we got a chance to play the game before it was released and had a lot of fun playing with their 
		development team. Congratulations to their entire team for getting it out the door, and we're 
		looking forward to watching it evolve over time. Head on over to their 
		<a href="http://www.planofattackgame.com/">website</a> to download and play the latest version.<br>
		<br>
		Another interesting Source-based game has been announced today. The Alien Swarm team launched a 
		new <a href="http://www.blackcatgames.com/swarm/">site</a> showing off the Source version of 
		their game, and IGN has the first <a href="http://pc.ign.com/articles/608/608624p1.html">preview</a>
		up on their page. We're all looking forward to seeing what their team can do with their game using
		Source.<br>
		<br>
		Lastly, we promised some new media on the Counter-Strike: Source version of de_inferno this week, 
		but we didn't quite have enough time to get everything together. We're now shooting for getting that 
		done next week.<br>
