  We're planning on releasing de_port and de_inferno next week. Along with the two new maps, we'll
  be releasing an updated version of the current CT model. There is a screenshot below of the new
  CT in the Source version of Inferno.<br>

  We'll also be showing off some products at this year's Electronic Entertainment Expo. Half-Life
  2 Xbox will be shown in the Xbox area of Microsoft’s booth.  Meanwhile Half-Life 2: Lost Coast,
  which is the new, single-player level created to introduce High-Dynamic Range (HDR) lighting to
  the Source engine, is slated to appear in the Games for Windows area at the show.<br>
