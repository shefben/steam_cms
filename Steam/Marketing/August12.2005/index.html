	<h1>Friday, August 12 2005</h1>
	<br>
	Last week we <a href="http://www.steampowered.com/Steam/Marketing/August5.2005/">mentioned</a> that we'd be announcing a new product coming to Steam soon.<br>
	<br>
	We're excited to announce that <!-- <a href="http://personal.lionhead.com/mhealey/"> --> <i>Rag Doll Kung Fu</i><!-- </a> -->, developed primarily by Mark Healy, will be making its way to Steam in the coming weeks. Mark is a game industry veteran who developed Rag Doll Kung Fu in his spare time. He initially showed the game off in the Experimental Game area of the Game Developers Conference earlier this year, where it stood out among a crowd of great looking games.<br>
	<br>
    In Rag Doll Kung Fu you act as a puppeteer in a martial arts world, but that doesn't really describe what this game is about. With most games we would use this space to describe what its like to play, but in this case we don't think it's possible -- you'll just have to watch the <a href="http://storefront.steampowered.com/video/RagDoll_KungFu.wmv">gameplay trailer</a> to understand. In short, it's all about Chi power.<br>
