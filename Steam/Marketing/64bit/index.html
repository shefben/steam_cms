	<h1>Available Now: 64-Bit Half-Life&reg; 2 and Lost Coast&trade;</h1><Br>

<a target="_new" href="http://amd64downloads.filecloud.com/hl2.asp"><img style="margin-right:16px;" align="left" src="img/athlon_64_FX.gif"></a>For those of you running with a 64-bit capable AMD&reg; processor, along with the Windows&reg; 64-bit operating system, Half-Life 2 and Lost Coast are now available in native 64-bit versions. Steam will automatically detect your OS and run the appropriate version the next time you run these games.<br>
<br>
We've been working with AMD to get the Source&trade; engine up and running in 64-bit mode to make sure we're taking advantage of these hardware configurations. This is just a first step for Valve into 64-bit. Going forward, we realize that more and more of our customers will be running with 64-bit processors and we will be set to take true advantage of them.<br>
<br>
The official press release is available <a target="_new" href="http://steampowered.com/index.php?area=news&id=496">here</a>. <br>
