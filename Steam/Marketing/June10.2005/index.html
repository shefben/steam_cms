	We've been pretty quiet about Day of Defeat: Source in the last few weeks. But new information and images from DoD: Source will be made available starting next week, as we lead to its release. We've been steadily working away on this project, and we're excited to see what everyone thinks of what we've produced.
 	<br>
	In the coming weeks we'll also be releasing a Source revived version of Half-Life 1: Deathmatch. People who already own Half-Life 1: Source will receive this as a free download.
 	<br><br>
	Next Saturday, Valve's CEO and founder, Gabe Newell, will be giving the commencement speech at Southern Methodist University's <i>Guildhall</i>, a university program offering course work in game design. Two groups of students enrolled in the program will be releasing the Source MODs they produced during their term. More information on the games they've built is available on their websites:
