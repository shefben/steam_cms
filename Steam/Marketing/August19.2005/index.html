	<h1>Friday, August 19 2005</h1>
	<br>
	In the next month or so there will be a number of Valve products being made available on Steam, but this week we'd like to spotlight a game that is being built using the Source engine.<br>
	<br>
	<a href="http://www.mightandmagic.com/us/darkmessiah/teaser/">Dark Messiah of Might and Magic</a> has been announced, and is being developed by Arkane Studios. Everyone around Valve played most of the previous Might and Magic games, and we're all big fans of Arkane's previous work. Like a lot of gamers, we're looking forward to playing the finished product.<br>

	<br>
	We'll also be releasing Half-Life: Blue Shift on Steam next week, which will be automatically playable by anyone who owns Half-Life 1, including those who purchased the <a href="steam://store" target=_self >Half-Life 2 Silver or Gold packages</a>.<br>
