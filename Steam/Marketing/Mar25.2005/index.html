			Next week we'll begin beta testing the new Valve Anti-Cheat system. For people playing multiplayer games, there will not be any visible difference while we're conducting the beta, but we will be logging cheating violations into our database to make sure it's ready for general release. This will be the last public notice before the system is released and active for everyone. 
		<br>
		<br>
			If you have any cheats for multiplayer games installed on your 
			computer, now would be a good time to uninstall and stop using 
			them. When a cheat infraction is detected, the offender will be 
			permanently banned from playing on secure servers. 
		<br>
		<br>
			In lighter news, work is progressing on Lost Coast, that is the 
			level we've built to showcase a new piece of rendering technology 
			coming to Source called High Dynamic Range lighting, first mentioned 
			<a href="http://www.steampowered.com/Steam/Marketing/Feb4.2005/">here</a>.
			Valve's Doug Lombardi will be showing the level on G4 TV next Wednesday, 
			March 30th. More information on the broadcast is available 
			<a href="http://www.g4tv.com/attackoftheshow/features/51399/Exclusive_New_HalfLife_2_Technology_.html">here</a>.
