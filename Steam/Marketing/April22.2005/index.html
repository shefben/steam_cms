		<h1>Friday, April 22 2005</h1>
		<br>
		This week we'd like to give everyone some information on our new Counter-Strike: Source map that
		we've been working on, as well as a new Half-Life 2: Deathmatch map we'll be releasing next
		week.<br>
		<br>
		It is a bit daunting to learn a new Counter-Strike map right as it's released, so we've gone
		through de_port and tried to give people an idea of what our design intentions were. Click
		<a href="http://steampowered.com/games/css/strategy/">here</a> to get to a page that outlines six
		different strategies to try once the map is available. We're still shooting for release of
		de_port (along with a redone de_inferno) in a couple of weeks. Next week's Steam news will
		include some pictures showing off what de_inferno looked like as it was being built from
		scratch.<br>
		<br>
		We'll be releasing a new Half-Life 2: Deathmatch map this coming Monday the 25th. This new
		Valve created map is called dm_runoff and was inspired by a Half-Life 1 favorite,
		<i>Crossfire</i>.<br>
