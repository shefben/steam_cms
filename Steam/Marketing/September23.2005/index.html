	<br>
	Day of Defeat: Source is ready and we're set to make it available on Monday, September 26, at 3 pm PDT. For those who have not yet pre-purchased the game, the 10% pre-purchase discount offer ends when it is released.<br>
	<br>
	In addition to pre-loading DoD: Source, another good thing to do in preparation of its release is to update your video card driver. With HDR and other advanced features included, DoD: Source pushes the limits of the Source engine a bit harder than other Source games. Check over at <a href=http://www.nvidia.com>NVIDIA</a> or <a href=http://www.ati.com>ATI</a> website for driver updates, depending on your hardware.<br>
	<br>
	Day of Defeat: Source will be available as an individual purchase via Steam, as well as part of the Counter-Strike: Source retail package that will be available at stores around the same time. Half-Life 2: Silver and Gold package customers will automatically be able to play.<br>
	<br>
	Finally, as we await the game's arrival, IGN.com posted a <a href=http://pc.ign.com/articles/652/652450p1.html>preview</a> this week with a large collection of DoD: Source shots and video footage. Full reviews will be appearing beginning this weekend and web sites and in game magazines.<br>
