	<br>
	Next week we're planning on releasing the remade version of cs_assault to Counter-Strike: Source owners. If you don't currently own CS: Source, you can purchase it through Steam via <a href="steam://store">any of the Half-Life 2 packages</a>. Along with the release of cs_assault, we'll be including a rebuilt version of the existing Terrorist model. Over the next few months we'll be expanding the model selections for both teams.<br>

	If you're a MOD developer, or just someone who likes to keep an eye on the MOD community, head on over to the <a target="_new" href="http://developer.valvesoftware.com">Valve Developer Community</a> that we launched earlier this week. The site is based around a Wiki, which is a webpage that allows the community to contribute to the site directly.<br>
