	The preload for Day of Defeat: Source is in full swing now. There is still plenty of time for everyone to <b><a href="steam://preload/300">pre-load the game</a></b> before it is made available on September 26th at 3:00 pm PDT. (If you're unsure of what time this is for you locally, you can <a target="_new" href="http://www.worldtimeserver.com/convert_time_in_US-WA.aspx?y=2005&mo=9&d=26&h=15&mn=0">convert to your local time zone here</a>.)<br>
	<br>
	We're also planning a release for next week that will update the Source engine to the same version used for Day of Defeat: Source. There are a number of small fixes contained in this release that we'll cover in detail when it's closer to release time.<br>
	<br>
	Have a look at two more of the character models from Day of Defeat: Source -- the Allied bazooka class and the Axis sniper class:<br>
