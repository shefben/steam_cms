		<br>
		We're still on track for releasing an update to Counter-Strike: Source tomorrow.<br>
		<br>
		While we've been talking for a number of weeks about the new hostage rescue map we've been working on (cs_compound), Turtle Rock Studios has also been working on getting de_train converted over to Counter-Strike: Source. Along with cs_compound, we'll be including the new version of de_train in tomorrow's release.<br>
		<br>
		Along with the two new maps, there are a number of fixes to the bots in Counter-Strike, an enhancement to the radar to display your current location in the map, and a fix for Half-Life 2: Deathmatch where players are disguising themselves as headcrabs, filing cabinets, and other invalid models.<br>
		<br>
		Here's a preview of de_train:<br>
