	We hope everyone who is playing Day of Defeat: Source is having as much fun playing it as we had building it. Most of the team has been spending this week jumping around on servers and playing with people. It's great to get on and play something you've worked on for a number of months with a wider group of people.<br>
	<br>
	Next week we'll start preloading Rag Doll Kung Fu, leading up to its release on Wednesday, October 12th at 3:00 pm PST. Coming ahead of its release will be a Steam update which restructures the way games are presented in Steam to accommodate the release of more products.<br>
	<br>
	We recently refreshed the hardware survey that helps give us and other game developers a better sense of the community's hardware. This latest version of the survey has had over 800,000 responses. You can <a href="http://www.steampowered.com/status/survey.html">head over to the webpage</a> to see where your individual hardware fits in.<br>
