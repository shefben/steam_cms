	<h1>Friday, January 27 2006</h1><Br>
	Preloading is underway for two new products on Steam, <a href="steam://store/1610">Space Empires IV</a> and <a href="steam://store/1600">Dangerous Waters</a>. If you'd like to be ready to play those games the moment they are available, you may preload them now. The preload for <i>Red Orchestra</i>, is also right around the corner.<br>
	<br>
	In February we'll be releasing two more Counter-Strike: Source player models. Those will be the <i>Leet Krew</i> and <i>SAS</i>, one for each side in the game. They should be ready for a screenshot next week.<br>
	<br>
	Next week there may also be a challenge match to watch between some people at Valve and the <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.hl2ctf.com">HL2CTF</a> team. If we get all of the details nailed down, we'll make sure everyone knows how to watch it via SourceTV. <br>
