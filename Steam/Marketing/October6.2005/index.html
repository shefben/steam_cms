	<h1>Thursday, October 6 2005</h1>
	<br>
	The original marketing for this date was not archived fully and is therefore most likely lost to time.<br>
	<br>
	However, a thumbnail of a HL2 Citadel concept art print has been preserved and so it was likely to be an advert for a poster or something similar in the Valve store.<br>
	<br>

	<br>
	This date is also the beginning of Steam 3, starting with the new UI entering public beta. The beta can be activated with:<br>
	<br>
	<i>Steam.exe -clientbeta betaui</i><br>
