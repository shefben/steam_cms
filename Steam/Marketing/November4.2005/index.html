	<h1>Friday, November 4 2005</h1><Br>
		Last week we talked about some of the new content coming to Counter-Strike: Source, namely two new maps along with an expanded selection of player models. The first piece we release will be the map de_nuke, shown in the screenshot below. Also visible in the shot are the new Guerilla and GIGN player models. Before the map is released we'll be adding High Dynamic Range lighting, so de_nuke will provide the first opportunity (for people who have capable hardware) to see HDR in Counter-Strike: Source. The map should be ready to go in a few weeks, and the new player models will show up shortly after Nuke is made available.<br>

		We're also getting close to finishing our next Day of Defeat: Source map, Argentan. We're doing daily playtests on it now, and hopefully we'll be able to put together some images of it next week. <br>
