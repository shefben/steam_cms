For about 4 hours Thursday night, Steam service was interrupted. After that time, service continued to be slow until about 11:00 am PST today (Friday). These problems were caused by device failure on our network following a power outage. We apologize for the inconvenience -- we're currently increasing redundancy in these areas to prevent this from happening in the future.<br/></p>
