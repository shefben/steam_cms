<DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><b>PC Gamer Declares Half-Life 2 <br>"The Most Important Game You'll Ever Play" <br>in World-Exclusive First Review </b></div><br><br><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><i>#1 PC Games Mag awards Half-Life 2 highest-ever 98% rating and <br>"Editors' Choice"</i></div> <br><br><br><b>"It's history in the making." - Editor-in-Chief Dan Morris</b><br><br><i>(Brisbane, CA) October 15, 2004</i> - <i>PC Gamer</i>, the world's best-selling PC games magazine, got a world-exclusive first look at hotly-anticipated <i>Half-Life 2</i> in its December issue, which hits newsstands October 19th, 2004. The game was given an "Editors' Choice" award and a review rating of 98%, the highest rating in the magazine's history. <br> <br><i>PC Gamer</i> was the first publication invited to review <i>Half-Life 2</i>. The December issue of <i>PC Gamer</i> features a 9-page review written by Senior Editor Chuck Osborn, exclusive screen captures, and a four-page technical Q & A with Gary McTaggart, Valve's resident tech guru. <br> <br>"<i>Half-Life 2</i> is arguably the best game ever made to date. It is a groundbreaking experience in interactive entertainment," states <i>PC Gamer</i>'s Senior Editor, Chuck Osborn, "While some games have groundbreaking visuals, or intellectually-challenging gameplay, or perhaps a cinematic story with good voice acting, not one has ever delivered the complete package.  <i>Half-Life 2</i> nails it, surpassing the original in every way."<br> <br>Sales of the groundbreaking, next generation first-person PC shooter <i>Half-Life</i> exceed more than 10 million units worldwide to date and devotees have waited six years for the sequel. The release marks the debut of Valve's revolutionary new Source engine, which enables cutting-edge graphics and takes advantage of the newest video cards and processors. <br> <br>The review takes readers through the entire game, focusing on the gameplay and sheer enjoyment and highlighting the enhanced environments, new weapons, plot, character animation, sound and more. The review also boasts a description of <i>Counter-Strike: Source</i> - the multiplayer mode that ships with <i>Half-Life 2</i>.<br> <br>Additionally, <i>PC Gamer</i>'s Hard Stuff section features a four-page Q & A with Gary McTaggart, Valve Software's resident tech guru, titled "12 Things You Need to Know About running <i>Half-Life 2</i> on Your PC". It details what readers can anticipate from the games visuals and expect from their existing system specs, including minimum system spec requirements and upgrade options for optimal performance. <br> <br>"Valve is honored to have the first <i>Half-Life 2</i> review featured as the cover of the December 2004 issue of <i>PC Gamer</i> and its many international affiliates," says Doug Lombardi, Director of Marketing at Valve. "For over a decade, <i>PC Gamer</i> has been the authority for gamers and industry insiders. In spring 1997, <i>PC Gamer UK</i> filed the first-ever preview of <i>Half-Life</i>. Today, <i>PC Gamer</i> is a worldwide voice and a flagship among Future's fleet of leading publications.<br> <br>Future Network USA's Group Publisher, Simon Whitcombe, states, "As the editorial and circulation market-leader, <i>PC Gamer</i> is the obvious choice in which to debut new games and reach hardcore, early purchasing gamers. Additionally, <i>PC Gamer</i> is an ideal partner because it also reaches a wider games audience and continues to generate excitement for games long after their launch with its monthly Extended Play section, dedicated to sourcing and providing extensions, game mods and downloads. "<br> <br>Rounding out a blockbuster issue, the December <i>PC Gamer</i> also features a contest for a customized, $6,000 <i>Half-Life 2</i> super-PC from Falcon Northwest <a Href="www.falcon-nw.com">(www.falcon-nw.com)</a>. The contest is sponsored by Falcon Northwest.<br> <br>"Valve has forged the framework for the next generation of games, demonstrating what our medium can and should be able to accomplish," Osborn concludes in his review. <i>Half-Life 2</i> is "an exhilarating entertainment that can emotionally move you one moment, kick ass the next, and keep you immersed the whole time."<br> <br><br><u>About PC Gamer Magazine</u><br>Launched in May 1994, <i>PC Gamer</i> is the world's best-selling PC games magazine.
