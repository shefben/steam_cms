There seems to be a lot of confusion over the proposed plan to pull the plug on WON.  WON <em>will be available</em> until the Steam service is working the way it was intended to.  We will not simply pull the plug.  If you wish to, you can reinstall Half-Life (if necessary) and play Counter-Strike 1.5 the way you always have.<br/><br/>I hope that eases some fears.<br/><br/>Some of the constructive feedback we've received has been quite valuable, and we're working to create a product that everyone will be happy with.<br/></p>
