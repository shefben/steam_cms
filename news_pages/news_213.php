We have released a game engine update via Steam this evening. This release includes a number of additions and bug fixes, including one which should clear up the remaining cases of the authentication error people have been getting today.<br/><br/>Server admins please note that this release will require all game servers to restart. If you run a server on Windows, you'll need to restart manually; Linux servers will restart automatically if the server admin has enabled that option.<br/><br/><ul style="padding-bottom: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><b>GAME &amp; ENGINE CHANGES:</b><br/><li>Fixed a Steam authentication error ("Invalid User ID Ticket") that occurred when connecting to any server which was run from the Steam Games list</li><br/><li>Added check to make sure only one instance of the game is running</li><br/><li>Added code to try help diagnose the 'filesystem dll not found' sporadic error</li><br/><li>Fixed startup crash where the text file buffer wasn't always terminated correctly causing bad info to be parsed out</li><br/><li>Changed error string "BADPASSWORD" to be a friendly string</li><br/><li>Added some more info to help debug 'could not load filesystem' error</li><br/><li>Fixed mouse cursor staying visible when alt-tabbing back into the game when in windowed mode</li><br/><li>Fixed corrupted VGUI2 text when using the TriAPI</li><br/><li>Added fallback to software mode if selected video mode is not supported when game tries to start</li><br/><li>Fixed bug where singleplayer games were listed in the Mods list for HLDS.</li><br/><li>Fixed bug where the Mod previously used wasn't being loaded properly (and saved) the next time you ran HLDS.</li><br/><li>Fixed 'load failed' error causing players to timeout from server during level changes</li><br/><li>Fixed problem pulling crates in half-life</li><br/><li>Fixed mp3 volume slider not taking effect immediately</li><br/><li>Fixed changing the bitdepth in video options not making the apply button show up</li><br/><li>Fixed downloading of custom content from a server never saying 'complete'</li><br/><li>Fixed sponsor banner never being shown in the game</li><br/><li>Fixed game menus still be clickable even when hidden by game load dialog</li><br/><li>Added compression to server-&gt;client file transfers, reduces connection time downloading security module -- controlled by "sv_filetransfercompression" cvar.</li><br/><li>Fixed crash opening options dialog if "voice_enable 0" was in the config.cfg file</li><br/><li>Changed default player name to be the users' friends name</li><br/><li>Fixed timer graphic not displaying in Counter-Strike</li><br/><br/><b>MOD MAKER CHANGES:</b><br/><li>Fixed "condump" command</li><br/><li>Fixed corrupted VGUI2 text when using the TriAPI (only happened in mods)</li><br/><li>Added greater control of game startup background &amp; layout -- controlled by resource/BackgroundLayout.txt, BackgroundLoadingLayout.txt</li><br/><li>Increase MAX_HUD_SPRITES from 128 to 256</li><br/><li>Added avi playback option to game startup - the text file media/StartupVids.txt contains the list of avi's to play</li><br/><li>Changed missing models to only be fatal error when developer cvar &gt; 1</li><br/></ul><br/></p>
