Our good friend and provider of amusing links such as this passed on this message. yea yea I know I know, it's not about the next release yea yea yea gimme a break! :^)<br/><br/>Anyway...<br/><br/><a href="http://www.redphive.org/" target="_blank">Red Phive Gaming</a> is pleased to announce the creation of our second league based on the Half Life engine. Building on the strong reputation of its well-established Counter-Strike league, R5G will be adding Day of Defeat to its list of competitive games. <br/><br/>Pre-season rounds are expected to begin by the 4th week of March with a modified ladder - tournament style play for the 9 weeks following leading up to single elimination playoffs. The first place team will be presented with a prize for their efforts, and will most likely consist of a 14 player private Day of Defeat server. Class limitations will be made use of for the league and they are as follows:<br/><br/>4 Riflemen/Grenadiers <br/>4 Sergeant/Unteroffizier <br/>1 Sniper/Scharfschütze <br/>2 Support Infantry/Scharführer <br/>1 Machine Gunner/MG-Schütze <br/><br/>More information can be found at <a href="http://league.redphive.org/dod/" target="_blank">http://league.redphive.org/dod/</a> or in IRC #r5league on irc.gamesnet.net.<br/></p>
