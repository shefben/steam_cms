As <em>many</em> of you have noticed, Steam is back up now. Launching Steam and getting into a game should work just fine. Friends does currently work while playing a game, but not from the desktop. The Friends servers require some networking changes before they're fully functional again. We're working on this now.<br/><br/>As always, get in touch if you have any questions.<br/></p>
