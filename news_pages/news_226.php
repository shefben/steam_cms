A few small updates to Steam games are being released this week. These updates only affect players who run Steam games in languages other than English. Later today, an update will be released for non-English versions of Counter-Strike and Day of Defeat. No changes to the games are included, this is a maintenance release only.<br/><br/>(Happy New Year!)<br/></p>
