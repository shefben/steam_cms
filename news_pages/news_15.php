Got this in the mail the other day from MFOTS (Founder of Battle For Europe)...<br/><br/><em class="newsquote">For over a 18 months now, Battle For Europe has been hosting some of the most intense and unique competitions in online gaming. Thousands of gamers have enlisted in our online tournaments, and this month, we're hoping that we can convince the rest of you to sign up, so we're running a FREE full six weeks of our Day of Defeat BFE game.<br/><br/>Battle For Europe is a simulated war for control of Europe, where Campaigns are waged by the Allied or Axis forces to conquer all of the territories in Europe. Think of this game as a cross between a strategy board game and an FPS, allowing you to submerge yourself in realistic WWII environments and strategy.<br/><br/>The campaign starting March, 29th will be free for EVERYONE (over 500 players have already signed up!). Whether or not you're currently registered for BFE, you're invited to sign up and play an entire six week campaign. If you've played BFE in the past, you might be surprised how much things have changed. If you've never played BFE before, you owe it to yourself to give it a try!<br/><br/>Join the largest DoD tournament on the planet at: <a href="http://dod.battleforeurope.com/" target="_blank">http://dod.battleforeurope.com/</a></em><br/></p>
