A small Steam update was released earlier today. There were only a couple of changes in this release:<br/><ul style="padding-bottom: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><li>Fixed problem with command-line parameters not being passed through correctly (for shortcuts to launching steam games)</li><br/><li>Optimized some Steam networking code and decreased startup time</li><br/></ul><br/></p>
