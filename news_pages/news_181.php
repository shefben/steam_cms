We've been making final changes to the Steam network throughout the night. Unfortunately, it's taken longer than we planned. However, the Steam dedicated server will be released this evening, and the Steam client release is now scheduled for tomorrow.<br/><br/>We're working to get the release out as fast as we can -- sorry for the delay, and thanks for your patience.<br/></p>
