A set of small game server changes are being released tonight on Steam, along with a few localized files for German CS players. Dedicated servers will need to restart in order to receive the update. Some of the included changes are:<br/><br/><ul style="padding-bottom: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><li>Added some localized content to the German version of Counter-Strike</li><br/><li>Re-enabled bots on Linux CS:CZ servers</li><br/><li>Replace "#" with " " if it is the first character in a player's in-game name (this change applies to dedicated servers; listen servers already received this change)</li><br/><li>Ensured proper startup sequence for CS:CZ Windows dedicated servers</li><br/></ul><br/>The new version of the dedicated server is compatible with existing clients, so server administrators can apply this update at their discretion.<br/></p>
