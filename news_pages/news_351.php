A small number of Half-Life 2 customers have been experiencing problems while playing the game, and we have traced these issues to corrupt Steam cache files. We've released a Steam update to help resolve these issues. If you have been experiencing problems such as crashing during gameplay or startup of Half-Life 2, please  and then click on one of the links below. Steam will then automatically verify your cache files. The verification process will take roughly five minutes to complete.<br/><br/><a href="steam://validate/220">To validate Half-Life 2 click here</a><br/><br/><a href="steam://validate/240">To validate Counter-Strike: Source click here</a><br/><br/><a href="steam://validate/280">To validate Half-Life: Source click here</a><br/><br/>We're also investigating a solution for the sound skipping problems a small number of users are running into.
