This morning at about 8:30 PST, Steam was hit by a distributed denial of service attack. For about two and a half hours, Steam and its games were unavailable to users. We have since fixed the problem, and player numbers have returned to a normal state.<br/><br/>Steam's content servers are still busy with yesterday's update, but for the most part Steam users have been able to get up and running without problems.<br/><br/>The new email validation feature has been causing some users confusion. Our network problems have caused the validation emails to be delivered too slowly -- if you are waiting to receive your automated email response from Steam, please give it some time. We're sorry if this is causing inconvenience; the delivery speed will be improved soon.<br/><br/>Let us know if you're experiencing any other problems.<br/></p>
