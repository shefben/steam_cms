An update to the Steam client has just been released. Steam will update itself automatically when you restart. Here is a list of the changes:<br/><br/><ul style="padding-bottom: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><b>STEAM CLIENT CHANGES / ADDITIONS:</b><br/><li>Removed Exit &amp; Logout command<br/><li>Improved authentication system<br/><li>Improved UI feedback when Internet connection has been lost<br/><li>Improved pre-loading behavior (will no longer pause)<br/><li>Added new in-game languages: Japanese, Thai, &amp; Russian</li></li></li></li></li></ul><br/>This update includes a "Half-Life 2 Hardware Survey". This mostly automated survey collects information about Steam users' computer hardware (and some software). We plan to use this information to tune the performance of our games.<br/></p>
