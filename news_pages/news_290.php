The Valve Cyber Café License Server is now available to subscribers of the Valve Cyber Café Program. Among other features, the Cyber Café License Server allows cafés to manage their licenses on a concurrent user basis, locally update individual computers on a café's local area network (reducing bandwidth needs for updates), and allow individual users with personal Steam accounts to access their account on any computer station located at a cyber café site.<br/></p>
