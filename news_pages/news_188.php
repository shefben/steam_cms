Some people might be getting the following message when attempting to login to Steam:<br/><br/><em>"Login to steam failed.  Either the specified account does not exist, or the password was wrong.  Please check your email address and password and try again."</em><br/><br/>This is a bit misleading - your account exists and is fine.  The authentication servers are under heavy load right now.  This problem should be resolved shortly.  Thanks for your patience!<br/></p>
