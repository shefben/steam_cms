The Steam scheduled downtime and maintenance has been completed. We have also released a small Steam update.<br/><br/>Following the release of the update this morning, there was an issue preventing many of our users from connecting to game servers ("User ID Ticket Error 34", or similar). This has been fixed.<br/><br/>UPDATE: Many users are still experiencing the error mentioned above. We are investigating the problem now, and we'll have everything back to normal ASAP.<br/></p>
