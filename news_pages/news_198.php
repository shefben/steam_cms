Valve is offering a Steam games installation DVD-ROM for Cyber Café managers. If you manage a gaming venue and you'd like to receive the disk, email us at <a href="mailto:cafe@valvesoftware.com">cafe@valvesoftware.com</a>. If you're one of the café managers who has already written to us requesting this DVD, rest assured that your email has been received and you will soon receive the disk. They are still being manufactured, and will be sent out as soon as they are finished (within the next two weeks).<br/><br/>Very soon, we will post more detailed information for Cyber Café managers about the official Valve Cyber Café Program, including information on pricing (hint: $10 per computer per month &amp; you don't have to buy the retail software), technical instructions for setting up Steam in cafés, security info, etc.<br/></p>
