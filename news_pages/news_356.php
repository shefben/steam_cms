The changes in this release are directed at reducing the problem some users are experiencing with sound stuttering. The sound stuttering is not indicative of a sound problem, sound stuttering is only a symptom of texture thrashing on your video card or AGP memory. For information on how to reduce texture thrashing visit this link on our support site:<br/> <br/><a href="/support.php/cgi-bin/steampowered.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=280">/support.php/cgi-bin/steampowered.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=280</a><br/> <br/>This update will fix sound stuttering that users were experiencing that would last for longer than a few seconds during normal gameplay. This update will also eliminate this same behavior following a quicksave or autosave. There will still be a short pause while the autosave happens, but not the more drawn out stuttering behavior.<br/> <br/>We are still investigating another performance problem on some hardware, which will manifest where the game is getting into a state where performance drops to less than 5 fps and does not recover or crashes.<br/> <br/>Next week we will be releasing the Source SDK, along with a surprise for the community. <br/></p>
