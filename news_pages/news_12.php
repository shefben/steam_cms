Well it's pretty well known on our forums at least. DoD has won the "Best of 2002 User-Created Modification" vote on Fileplanet's recent Best of 2002 poll!<br/><br/>Here's a quote from FilePlanet's site on this...<br/><br/>"<em class="newsquote">The winners are in for the Best of 2002 User-Created Movies and Modifications! Militia 2 romped the competition in the user-created movies category and Day of Defeat managed to pull far ahead after a neck to neck race with Counter-Strike.</em>"<br/><br/>I might also add that the "Best User-Created Game Movies" win went to Militia2, which was mapped by Mojo &amp; Co. Mojo's currently working with us on a map for Beta4, so kudo's to Mojo too!<br/><br/>And above all, a big THANK YOU to the 9562 people who voted for DoD!<br/></p>
