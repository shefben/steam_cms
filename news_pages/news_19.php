We're looking for people who can provide a GOOD mirror for DoD. Besides relying on all the "standard" sites like Fileplanet and Shacknews, we'll want to get community mirrors as usual. A good bunch in Europe would be nice, maybe South America, etc.<br/><br/>Requirements: sufficient storage for 2-300 MB of content, plus sufficient bandwith to allow multiple downloads of installation at reasonable speeds.<br/><br/>WARNING! Don't do this if you have some cap on your traffic, or if you get charged for excessive traffic. We've had a few people get socked with BIG bills because they didn't realize this, or didn't realize just how much traffic they were going to get.<br/><br/>So if you are interested, please e-mail the <a href="mailto:DoDwebmaster@valvesoftware.com">DoD Webmaster</a> with the subject line "Mirror," your contact information, the site where you will be hosting the file, and the type of bandwidth you will be providing.<br/></p>
