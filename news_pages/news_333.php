Valve's debut title was named "Best PC Game Ever" by <i>PC Gamer</i> and launched a franchise with more than eight million retails units sold worldwide.  In 2004, <i>Half-Life 2</i> will take the suspense, challenge and visceral charge of the original to new heights of realism and responsiveness. <i>Half-Life 2</i> opens the door to a world where the player's presence affects everything around him, from the physical environments to the behaviors - even the emotions - of both friends and enemies.  The player again picks up the crowbar of research scientist, Gordon Freeman, who finds himself on an alien-infested Earth being picked to the bone, its resources depleted and its population dwindling.  Freeman is thrust into the unenviable role of rescuing the world from the wrong he unleashed back at Black Mesa.   And a lot of people - people he cares about - are counting on him.   The intense, real-time gameplay of <i>Half-Life 2</i> is made possible only by Source, Valve's new proprietary engine technology.   Source provides major enhancements in the advanced facial animation system, physics, graphics and AI.  <i>Half-Life 2</i> will be available for the PC.<br/><br/><br/><u>About Vivendi Universal Games</u><br/>Headquartered in Los Angeles, VU Games is a leading global developer, publisher and distributor of multi-platform interactive entertainment.
