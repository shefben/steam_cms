<p>Before posting a problem in the forums, please use the new interactive Steam Support system..  It contains answers for many of the most common problems and questions.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="support.php">Use the Steam Support system.</a></p>

<p>Below are some forum usage guidelines. They are posted here as a general reminder in an effort to keep the forums friendly and usable for everyone.</p>

<ul><em>
<li style="list-style-image:url(/img/square2.gif);"> The forums are for everyone, new and advanced user alike.<br>
<br>
<li style="list-style-image:url(/img/square2.gif);"> Before you post a question, use the <a href="/forums/search.php" target="_blank">forum search feature</a> to determine whether your topic has already been covered.<br>
<br>
<li style="list-style-image:url(/img/square2.gif);"> Do not start flame wars. If you have a problem with someone, message that person and carry on a private discussion. Also, if someone has engaged in behavior that is a detriment to the message board -- spamming, flaming people, etc -- contact one of the forum moderators. Flaming the offensive user will only increase the problem.<br>
<br>
<li style="list-style-image:url(/img/square2.gif);"> Please post in the correct forum.<br>
<br>
<li style="list-style-image:url(/img/square2.gif);"> Administrators/Moderators reserve the right to change, edit, or delete any content at any time if they feel it is inappropriate.<br>
</em></ul>

<p>The bottom line is: respect others and you will be treated with respect. Be rude and disrespectful, and you'll not find much help here.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="/forums/"> I agree to these terms.</a></p>
