<h3>STEAM BASICS</h3>

<br>

<p><a name="#basics1"><strong><em>What is Steam?</em></strong></a></p>

<div style="padding-left: 40px;">
<p>Steam is Valve's new broadband platform for direct software delivery and content management.</p>

<p>Steam lets you:</p>

<ul>
<li style="list-style-image:url(img/square.gif);"> Buy Valve games via the Internet, and start playing within minutes of confirming your purchase
<li style="list-style-image:url(img/square.gif);"> Access your games from any PC
<li style="list-style-image:url(img/square.gif);"> Stop worrying about product updates and patches (they're all handled automatically!)
<li style="list-style-image:url(img/square.gif);"> Instant-message your friends, even while playing games.
<li style="list-style-image:url(img/square.gif);"> Browse and connect to game servers
<li style="list-style-image:url(img/square.gif);"> See when your friends are playing, and join their games
</ul><br>

<p>In addition to using Steam to deliver games, Valve is also making Steam available to other software developers. Steam is a distributed file system and shared set of technology components that can be implemented into any software application. With Steam, software developers are given integrated tools for direct-content publishing, flexible billing, ensured-version control, anti-cheating, anti-piracy, and more. The Steam SDK also includes an integrated set of communications tools and Valves Graphic User Interface (V-GUI) that provide built-in support for a variety of services such as instant messaging, configuration, and server browsing.</p>

<p><a name="#basics2"><strong><em>Where can I get Steam?</em></strong></a></p>

<div style="padding-left: 40px;">
<p><a href="getsteamnow.htm">Right here</a>.</p>

<p>Also, Steam will soon be included in any new Valve products sold in retail stores.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#">top</a></sup></p>
</div>

<p><a name="#basics3"><strong><em>Is Steam really free?</em></strong></a></p>

<div style="padding-left: 40px;">
Yes, Steam is really free.

<p>Steam also provides access to several free products and services, like the dedicated game server, instant messaging, the game server browser, etc. </p>

<p>And if you've already bought Half-Life or one of the other Half-Life family of games, several add-ons are available via Steam for no extra cost.</p>

<p>After installing Steam, check your "Games" list to see what's available.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#">top</a></sup></p>
</div>

<p><a name="#basics4"><strong><em>Will I still be able to buy Valve's games in stores?</em></strong></a></p>

<div style="padding-left: 40px;">
<p>Yes, Valve's games will still be available for purchase in stores.</p>

<p>Some users will prefer to have a boxed copy of our games, or won't have access to a fast enough Internet connection to aquire game content (the games can be several hundred megabytes each).</p>

<p>Even though some users may choose not to buy games via Steam, Steam will still be useful as a way to chat with other players, find multiplayer game servers, and more.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#">top</a></sup></p>
</div>

<p><a name="#basics5"><strong><em>What are the system requirements for Steam?</em></strong></a></p>

<div style="padding-left: 40px;">
<p>Windows 98, ME, 2000 or XP <br />
64 MB RAM <br />
400 Mhz processor <br />
1GB HD space (strongly recommended) <br />
Broadband Internet connection (recommended but not required) <br /></p>

<p>It is also recommended that Steam be installed on a hard disk formatted using NTFS. Fat32 drives will work, but performance will be slower.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#">top</a></sup></p>
</div>

<p><a name="#basics6"><strong><em>What products are available through Steam?</em></strong></a></p>

<div style="padding-left: 40px;">
<p>Currently Valve is offering its entire catalog of games via Steam. Also, Valve's games which are currently still in development will be released via Steam as soon as they are finished.</p>

<h3>TECHNICAL SUPPORT</h3>

<br />

<p><a name="#technical1"><strong><em>I'm getting an error saying I can't connect to Steam right now. Why?</em></strong></a></p>

<div style="padding-left: 40px;">
<p>Please check your internet connection to make sure it is functioning properly.</p>

<p>If you're sure that your 'Net connectivity is functioning but you are still unable to log in to Steam, it may be because the required ports are blocked by a device on your network (such as a router).</p>

<p>The following ports must be "open":<br />
UDP 1200<br />
UDP 27000 to 27015 inclusive<br />
TCP 27030 to 27039 inclusive<br /></p>

<p>Finally, if you've checked all of the above and are still having trouble, you may want to double check Steam's network status to make sure the system is online.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#">top</a></sup></p>
</div>

<p><a name="#technical2"><strong><em>Do I have to be connected to the Internet when I play Steam games?</em></strong></a></p>

<div style="padding-left: 40px;">
<p>The short answer is yes.</p>

<p>All Steam-enabled games require you to be connected to the Internet in order to play.</p>

<p>Note: some Steam-enabled single-player games (such as Half-Life 2) purchased at a retail store will allow offline play until the user decides to play online or enable other Steam functionality. From that point on, an Internet connection will be required.</p>
<p><sup><a href="#">top</a></sup></p>
</div>

<p><a name="#technical3"><strong><em>I've got Steam installed - why can't I connect?</em></strong></a></p>

<div style="padding-left: 40px;">
<p>If you get an error message saying that Steam cannot connect properly, please check your ports. Steam requires that your firewall have the following ports open:</p>

<p>UDP 1200<br />
UDP 27000 to 27015 inclusive<br />
TCP 27030 to 27039 inclusive<br /></p>

<p>For information about how to control your networking device to open those ports, check the documentation that came with your device or the manufacturer's web site.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#">top</a></sup></p>
</div>

<p><a name="#technical4"><strong><em>I'm getting a "This game is currently unavailable" message. What gives?</em></strong></a></p>

<div style="padding-left: 40px;">
<p>This error can happen when the Steam network is experiencing problems or downtime. Please see the <a href="status.html">Steam Network Status</a> page.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#">top</a></sup></p>
</div>

<p><a name="#technical5"><strong><em>What does it mean when I get a "Ticket expired" error in Steam?</em></strong></a></p>

<div style="padding-left: 40px;">
<p>Usually, this just means you need to re-enter your login information so that Steam can authenticate you. You may need to exit Steam and restart it in order to do this.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#">top</a></sup></p>
</div>

<p><a name="#technical6"><strong><em>Does Steam collect or share my personal information?</em></strong></a></p>

<div style="padding-left: 40px;">
<p>Steam requires some personal information to function, like a valid email address.</p>

<p>For more information, please see <a href="/valvesoftware/privacy.htm">Valve's privacy policy</a>.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#">top</a></sup></p>
</div>

<p><a name="#technical7"><strong><em>How do I stop Steam from running automatically when I start my computer?</em></strong></a></p>

<div style="padding-left: 40px;">
<p>From the Steam icon in the notification tray, select Settings. Switch to the Interface tab, and uncheck the box that says "Run Steam when Windows starts".</p>

<p><sup><a href="#">top</a></sup></p>
</div>

<p><a name="#technical8"><strong><em>How can I have a LAN party or similar event using Steam?</em></strong></a></p>

<div style="padding-left: 40px;">
<p>Any Steam game, when played on a LAN or otherwise, requires that each individual client be able to authenticate via the Internet. </p>

<p>At a LAN party, this means that Internet access must be available to every machine on which Steam games are being played. </p>

<p>If desireable, the network administrator of such an event can limit internet access to only the TCP/IP ports which Steam needs. These are:</p>

<p>UDP 1200<br />
UDP 27000 to 27015 inclusive<br />
TCP 27030 to 27039 inclusive<br /></p>

<p>At large events, it will be necessary for each attendee to let their games fully update before attending to avoid taxing the shared internet connection with too much content delivery.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#">top</a></sup></p>
</div>

<p><a name="#technical9"><strong><em>How do I install and use mods in Steam?</em></strong></a></p>

<div style="padding-left: 40px;">
<p>If you have a Half-Life mod installed before installing Steam, Steam will automatically convert and install the game for you. It will then be accessible in the Steam "My Games" list under "Third Party Games."</p>

<p>If you want to add a mod after installing Steam, you need only to put it in the Steam/SteamApps/your_email_address/Half-Life directory. The next time you open the "My Games" list it will be listed under "Third Party Games."</p>

<p><sup><a href="#">top</a></sup></p>
</div>

<p><a name="#technical10"><strong><em>How do I use custom content in Counter-Strike?</em></strong></a></p>

<div style="padding-left: 40px;">
<p>You can drop in custom files, like the CS fusion pack, into your <em>Steam/SteamApps/your_email_address/Counter-Strike/</em> directory. Steam will use the cusomized files on disk instead of the ones in the Steam cache file.</p>
For a more in-depth set of instructions specific to the Fusion Pack, see <a href="http://forums.games-fusion.net/index.php?showtopic=1211">this tutorial</a> posted on Fusion.net. <br><br>

</div>

<p><a name="#technical0"><strong><em>Why is there non-Steam information in my Steam cache files? Is Steam Spyware?</em></strong></a></p>

<div style="padding-left: 40px;">
<p>Some users have seen non-Steam related information (like names of private files on their computer) show up inside their Steam cache files, raising privacy concerns. This is actually a result of the way Windows handles files. The cache file gets created on the client using the Windows CreateFile() command. This command will create the file but not initialize it. Due to the large size of the file, the Steam client does not initialize the empty data blocks in it as this can take an appreciable amount of time. On NTFS machines, files created with this method happen to have the property of appearing empty (initialized to zero) but for FAT32 machines, it shows up as whatever old data was sitting on drive in the sectors that just got allocated for the cache. This data is never uploaded or even read by the Steam client. Eventually, as Steam downloads more data, the old data is overwritten.</p>
