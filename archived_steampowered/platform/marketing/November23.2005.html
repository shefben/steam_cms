	<h1>Wednesday, November 23 2005</h1><Br>
	We're currently targeting Wednesday, November 30th as the release date for the updated version of de_nuke for Counter-Strike: Source, and Argentan for Day of Defeat: Source. Nuke will be the first Counter-Strike: Source map we've released that includes HDR lighting, and we think the community will like the way it looks. Argentan is the first in a series of new levels we are producing for Day of Defeat: Source.<br>

This MOD team was the winner of the "Make Something Unreal" contest. Red Orchestra: Ostfront 41-45 is a standalone follow-up with new single and multiplayer content, and it is due for release via Steam around the start of next year. You can get more information on it at the <a target="_new" href="http://www.redorchestragame.com">Red Orchestra web site</a>.<br>
