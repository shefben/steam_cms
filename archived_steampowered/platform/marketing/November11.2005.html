	<h1>Friday, November 11 2005</h1><Br>
		Over the next few weeks we'll have updates coming to Counter-Strike: Source and Day of Defeat: Source, starting with one new level for each. Last week we talked about de_nuke making its return to Counter-Strike, and this week we'd like to shed some light on the new Day of Defeat: Source map coming, named Argentan. We've included a screenshot from today's playtest.<br>

		Coming soon, we'll have news about a new game that's coming to Steam before the end of the year. We're looking forward to giving people a chance to check it out.<br>
