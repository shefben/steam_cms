	<a href="steam://openurl/http://www.steampowered.com/index.php?area=dodFreeWeekend">Day of Defeat: Source free weekend</a> is currently underway, so if you'd like to check it out and you haven't yet, this weekend is your chance. Until Midnight PST on Sunday February 12th, you can play the full version of the game for free. Just double-click on the game in your Steam games list. Right now, there are close to five times the normal number of people playing, so it shouldn't be hard to find a good match.<br>
