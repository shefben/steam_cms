	We hope everyone is enjoying Lost Coast. We've received a number of e-mails with positive feedback about the commentary system included in Lost Coast, so it's a safe bet that we'll look for ways to include commentary in future products.<br>

	We're now going to be looking toward releasing some new Counter-Strike: Source content we've been working on. The next two maps coming will be updated versions of de_nuke and cs_militia, along with a number of new player models for both sides. We'll give everyone a sneak peek at Nuke and some of the new models next week.<br>

Two weeks ago we <a target="_new" href="http://www.steampowered.com/Steam/Marketing/October14.2005/">mentioned</a> our affinity for all things zombie, along with the note that someone here at Valve had made a short movie on the subject. Zombie Movie has won Best Comedy Horror Short down at <a target="_new" href="http://www.screamfestla.com/">Screamfest L.A.</a> and we're looking forward to delivering the movie over Steam soon. We think everyone will get a kick out of it.<br>
