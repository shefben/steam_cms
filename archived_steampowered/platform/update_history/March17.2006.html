	Recently we refreshed the Steam hardware survey to get a fresh look at what kind of hardware the community is currently running. In this version of the survey, which many of you have already seen, we are gathering a number of new pieces of data. Now that we're approaching 500,000 unique responses, there are a few trends worth noting:<br>
  <ul>
  <li>Most of you (88%) are running with a traditional CRT as your display device.</li>
  <li>The split between AMD and Intel processors continues to stay very close as it has in the past. AMD has a slight lead with 52% of the community's processors.</li>
  <li>Nvidia and ATI video cards are the dominant providers, with Nvidia cards occupying about 52% of your PCs.</li>
  <li>Most of you have DVD drives in your PCs, or around 92%.</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	You can also check out the <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.steampowered.com/status/survey.html">full results of the survey</a>.<br>

	Meanwhile, Introversion released an update to <a href="steam://store/1500">Darwinia</a> last week to add a difficulty system to the game. People who purchased the game should have a fun challenge trying to make it through some of the later levels with these higher difficulty levels.<br>
