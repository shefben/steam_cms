		At approximately 4:00 pm PST we'll be releasing an update that primarily focuses on Half-Life 2: Deathmatch. This update will include the addition of the Stunstick, SLAM, and the Crowbar. It will also include a new original map made by Valve, called Steamlab.<br>
		<br>
		Along with the update to the game, we'll be releasing the source code for Half-Life 2: Deathmatch in an update to the Source SDK, which should give our MOD community a wide range of functionality they can use to build their games. We're all excited to see what is built based off of it. The update to the SDK will also allow MOD developers to write their own custom shaders, which will lead to some unique visuals in their games.<br>
		<br>
		Looking ahead to next week, we're still on track for the Counter-Strike update, which will include a new map called cs_compound, along with a number of smaller changes and bug fixes.<br>
