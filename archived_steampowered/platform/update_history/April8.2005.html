		On Tuesday we began running an updated version of our hardware survey. So far, we've had over 600,000 unique responses. You can see the current results <a href="http://www.steampowered.com/status/survey.html">here</a>.<br>
		<br>
		Running surveys like this are extremely useful for us as developers, as it helps us to understand what kinds of technology decisions we can make as we continue to invest in the Source engine. It should also be useful for MOD developers to get an idea of what their audience looks like.<br>

		Next week we'll be releasing the three HL2DM map contest winners on Steam. The winners of the contest along with some images of the maps were first mentioned <a href="http://steampowered.com/Steam/Marketing/Mar18.2005/">here</a>. Also next week, we'll have a small sneak peak for you of the upcoming Half-Life 2 episode "Aftermath".<br>
