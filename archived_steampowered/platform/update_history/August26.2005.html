	<h1>Friday, August 26 2005</h1>
	<br>
	Bringing owners of the original Half-Life a blast-from-the-past&trade;, earlier this week we released "Half-Life: Blue Shift" on Steam. This game was made by Gearbox Software and originally released in 2001 as an add-on to Half-Life. In it, you play as Barney Calhoun, the security guard sidekick who helped Gordon out of so many sticky situations back in the Black Mesa Research Facility.<br>

	Fans will remember that Blue Shift included a "High Definition Pack," a set of visually enhanced player and weapon models. We've had to iron out some technical wrinkles with how we deliver the HD Pack, but it will be made available through Steam within the next week or so.<br>

	We'd also like to take this opportunity to share <a href="August26.2005/img/DOD-S_Axis.jpg">an angry Axis soldier</a> running across the Day of Defeat: Source map "Flash." He and his shovel are coming soon to a Steam Games List near you. (It's difficult for us to pin the exact date down right now, but rest assured it's not far off.)
