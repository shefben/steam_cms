  <br>
  We are pretty caught up with E3 (the Electronic Entertainment Expo) again this year. Half-Life 2 Xbox is playable on the show floor, and lots of people are trying their hand at the Gravity Gun. We can't wait to get the game into the hands of Xbox owners.<br>
<br>
  Our HDR (High Dynamic Range lighting) demonstration of HL2's Lost Coast is also on display. This soon-to-be-released area of Half-Life 2 introduces a new character, whom we first mentioned (in the form of a concept sketch) <a href="http://www.steampowered.com/Steam/Marketing/Feb4.2005/">here</a>.<br>
