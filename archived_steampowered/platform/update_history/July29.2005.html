	<h1>Friday, July 29 2005</h1>
	<br>

	A number of months ago the development team behind <a href="http://www.hl2ctf.com">Half-Life 2: Capture the Flag</a> challenged us to a <a href="http://www.steampowered.com/Steam/Marketing/Mar2.2005/">match</a>. The outcome of that match is still disputed, but it was a lot of fun, and hopefully fun for the community to watch. Wed love to play against the development teams of any multiplayer MODs out there.<br>
	<br>
	The gauntlet has been thrown down once again by the CTF team, and we're more than happy to meet the challenge. This time around, however, we'll be using <a href="http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_TV">SourceTV</a> so the entire community can watch the match as it happens. This should eliminate any question as to the true victor.<br>
	<br>
	We're tentatively scheduled to do this in the next couple of weeks. Once we get closer to the main event we'll be letting everyone know how to connect to a SourceTV server and watch the match as it happens, along with the date and time. The CTF team has recently released version 1.5 of their game, so if you'd like to be more familiar with it before spectating, you can <a href="http://www.hl2ctf.com/downloads.php">download it here</a>.<br>
