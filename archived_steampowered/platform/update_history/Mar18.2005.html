		This week we're proud to announce the winners of the Half-Life 2: Deathmatch mapping contest. We were blown away by the quality of the levels that were entered; we think the community will be as well when the winning maps are released on Steam.<br>

		One reason to have a contest like this is to highlight the quality of work that the community is capable of producing. Over the next few weeks it will be just as exciting to see the community playing full games that MOD developers are currently working on.
