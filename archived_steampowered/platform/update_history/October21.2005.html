	This week we'd like to draw your attention to the work going on at <a target="_new" href="http://www.blackwidowgames.com"> Black Widow Games</a>, a long time Half-Life MOD team. They've just annouced "They Hunger: Lost Souls" a Source-based follow up to their "They Hunger" series of games. Head on over to <a target="_new" href="http://www.blackwidowgames.com">their site</a> to get a look at what they've done so far.<br>

	Our current plan is to release Half-Life 2: Lost Coast next week. Lost Coast is a free level for everyone who owns Half-Life 2, and serves as an HDR technology demo based in an unreleased section of the "Highway 17" chapter of Half-Life 2.<br>
	<br>
	After Lost Coast is released, we'll be working on getting some new content for both Counter-Strike: Source and Day of Defeat: Source, along with an update to the SDK, out the door. More info coming on that next week.<br>
