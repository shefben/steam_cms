		Yesterday, <a target="_new" href="http://www.steampowered.com/index.php?area=news&id=403">a minor update was released</a> for Counter-Strike: Source, the Source engine, and the Source Software Developer's Kit. Launching (or restarting) Steam will automatically get the updates.<br>
		<br>
		Also this week, many of us at Valve are attending the Game Developer's Conference in San Francisco. It's always nice to be able to compare notes with people in the industry, but this year we've been very honored to receive several of the Game Developer's Choice Awards for <a target="_new" href="http://half-life2.com">Half-Life 2</a>. These awards are especially meaningful to us, so we're feeling very grateful.<br>
		<br>
		We hope everyone playing Counter-Strike: Source is enjoying the new maps cs_compound and de_train. Coming soon, there will be another new map for CS:S called "de_port". As a teaser, here's a sketch of the layout.<br>
