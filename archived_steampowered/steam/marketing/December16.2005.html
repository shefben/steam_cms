	<h1>Friday, December 16 2005</h1><Br>

We have one more week of releases coming to Steam before we close out 2005. Next week there will be two new player models, one for each team, released for Counter-Strike: Source. Early next year we'll be releasing a completely rebuilt version of cs_militia. There is also a fairly high chance we'll be releasing an update to Day of Defeat: Source next week, which will include a number of small changes.<br>

<br>
Earlier this week Darwinia was launched, and from what we've gathered, people are really enjoying the game. If you're not sure if Darwinia is for you, check out the demo <a href="steam://store/1500">here</a>.<br>
<br>
We'd also like to congratulate the folks over at <a target="_new" href="http://www.darwinia.co.uk/">Introversion Software</a> for Darwinia's <a target="_new" href="http://www.igf.com/2006entrants.shtml">4 nominations</a> at next year's Independent Games Festival. As we've mentioned a number of times, we're all huge fans of the game, and it's great to see the game get the recognition it deserves.<br>
