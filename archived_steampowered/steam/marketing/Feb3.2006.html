	Congratulations to <i>Dangerous Waters</i> for being recognized as IGN's Game of the Month. You can head over <a target="_new" href="http://pc.ign.com/articles/684/684801p1.html">here</a> to read their writeup.  To check out <i>Dangerous Waters</i> or <i>Space Empires 4 Deluxe</i> as soon as they are available, preload and pre-purchase them before next Tuesday and take advantage of the preorder discount. This offer will expire next week when the games go live.<br>

	We mentioned last week that we'd be giving people a sneak peek at the two new models coming to <i>Counter-Strike: Source</i> this month, and hopefully these don't disappoint. Here are the new SAS and Leet Crew posing for the camera.<br>
