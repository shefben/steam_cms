	<h1>Friday, December 23 2005</h1><Br>



This was a busy week for us as far as releases were concerned, with updates to Counter-Strike: Source, the Source engine running in 64 bit, and Day of Defeat: Source. We hope everyone is enjoying the new content. The plan is to keep releasing updates and new games next year.<br>

<br>

There are literally millions of people in the community that connect to Steam each month, so we compiled a couple of statistics for what has happened in the past year:<br>

	<ul>

		<li>Steam has delivered approximately 10 million gigabytes of data since the first of the year. You could fill 125,000 80 GB hard drives with this data to make a line over 11 miles long. Not that you would want to, but the visual helps.</li> 

	    <li>There have been a total of 50 billion player minutes in our multiplayer games since the start of the year. If a single person sat down to play on their own, it would take 2.28 million years to accomplish this. This is assuming that you're not planning on sleeping during this 2 million year stretch.</li>

	</ul>
