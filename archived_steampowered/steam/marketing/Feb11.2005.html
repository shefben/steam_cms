		<br>

		In advance of the Counter-Strike: Source update we've mentioned here recently, we'll be releasing an update for Half-Life 2: Deathmatch. This update will include two new weapons (the StunStick and the Slam) as well as a return of the trusty crowbar. We've decided to also include a new map called "Steam Lab."<br>

		<br>

		Here are a few images:<br>

		Right around the same time, we'll be releasing the source code to Half-Life 2: Deathmatch in the SDK.<br>

		<br>

		This release will happen some time next week. Right now, we're shooting for Thursday the 17th.<br>

		<br>

		And just a quick note for those of you who have been asking -- <em>yes, VAC 2 is coming</em>.<br>
