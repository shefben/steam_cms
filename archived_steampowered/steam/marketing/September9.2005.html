	<h1>Friday, September 9 2005</h1>

	Preloading of Day of Defeat: Source will begin next week. It will be released and ready to play on September 26th. Once we get closer to that date, we'll set an exact time for when we'll "throw the switch." <br>

	<br>

	Preloading the game allows people to have the entire game on their hard drive in encrypted form so that, if already purchased or pre-ordered, it will be playable at the moment it is released. Dedicated server administrators will also have some time to get their servers up and running before the 26th.<br>

	<hr>

	There is also some pretty exciting news on the MOD front, where the team over at Dystopia is preparing to release a demo of their game today at 11:59 GMT. Head on over to <a href="http://www.dystopia-game.com ">the Dystopia page</a> to check out their release.
