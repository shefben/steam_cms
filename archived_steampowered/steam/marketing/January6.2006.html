	<h1>Friday, January 6 2006</h1><Br>

	This month we're planning map releases for both <a title="Click here to get Day of Defeat: Source" href="steam://store/300">Day of Defeat: Source</a> and <a title="Click here to get Counter-Strike: Source" href="steam://store/240">Counter-Strike: Source</a>. For Day of Defeat, we'll be releasing a completely rebuilt version of the classic map <i>Kalt</i>. Known as a balanced level set in winter (in German, Kalt means "cold"), Kalt is also a good choice for players who are new to Day of Defeat. For this release, there has even been some custom rendering work done in the Source engine specifically to make the snow and ice look realistic.<br>

	<br>

	For Counter-Strike: Source, we'll soon be releasing <i>Militia</i>. This version will be a fairly major reworking of the original level, and, like the recently released <i>Nuke</i>, it will include HDR.<br>

	<br>

	There is also now a <a title="Install the RDKF demo!" href="steam://install/1003">demo</a> available for Rag Doll Kung Fu that you can check out to see if it's the right game for you.<br>
