	<h1>Friday, March 31 2006</h1><br>

	The months of April and May are looking like they will be two of the busiest months for Steam since the launch of Half-Life 2. First, we'll be starting the preload and preparation for launch of <a href="steam://openurl/http://sinepisodes.com">SiN Episode 1: Emergence</a>, developed by Ritual Entertainment. This is the first in a series of installments set in the SiN universe that will be delivered via Steam. Next will be the preload and launch of the first in a series of episodic releases from Valve, Half-Life 2: Episode One. The preload for that will begin roughly one month before it is made available.<br>

	<br>

	Counter-Strike: Source and Day of Defeat: Source also have some new content nearing completetion. Counter-Strike: Source will see the addition of two new player models and an HDR enabled version of de_dust. Day of Defeat: Source has a new map on the way that will introduce a new gameplay mode.<br>

	<br>

	Lastly, we want to extend our congratulations to the <a href="steam://openurl/http://dystopia-game.com">Dystopia</a> team for winning the 2006 IGF Half-Life 2 Mod of the Year.<br>
