	<h1>Friday, December 2 2005</h1><Br>

	We've been having fun the past few days playing on Internet <a href="steam://store/300">Day of Defeat: Source</a> servers on the new map "Argentan," and on <a href="steam://store/240">Counter-Strike: Source</a>'s updated version of de_nuke. So far both maps have been really well received - we're glad everyone is enjoying them as much as we are. Next up on the Counter-Strike: Source front will be the release of two new player models.<br>

	<br>	

	This week on Steam, <a href="steam://store/1500">Darwinia</a> became available for pre-purchase at a discount of 10% off the full price, $19.95 USD. (This discount will remain in effect until the game is released on December 14th.) We're really excited to ship this title. Hint: don't make too many plans for December 15th, because you'll be tired from staying up all night. Here's <a href="http://storefront.steampowered.com/video/darwinia-steam.wmv">a video preview of Darwinia in action</a> (52MB).<br>

	The folks over at Ritual also have been keeping the community up to date with the development of the Sin Episodes. There are a couple of in-game screenshots below, and more over at <a target="_new" href="http://www.sinepisodes.com/">their site</a>. <br>
