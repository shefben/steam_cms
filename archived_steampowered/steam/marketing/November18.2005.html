In between trying to get all of the work done for the Day of Defeat: Source and Counter-Strike: Source releases we have planned, around Valve we've been playing a lot of Darwinia. We play virtually every game that comes out, and it's rare for everyone to be universally excited about one in the way that have with <a target="_new" href="http://darwinia.co.uk">Darwinia</a>. We're looking forward to putting it in front of people December 15th on Steam.<br>

Specifically, we made a T-Shirt that you can wear if you ever feel like you need to control a mechanical dog, along with a limited edition lithograph of the Citadel from Half-Life 2. Some of the new items are in very limited quantities, and are likley to sell out quickly.<br clear="all">

	And while not Steam related, Half-Life 2 for the XBOX is out in stores now. If you'd like to see what Half-Life 2 looks like in your living room, or you haven't played Half-Life 2 on the PC yet, head down to your local retailer and check it out.<br>
