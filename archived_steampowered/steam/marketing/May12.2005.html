  <h1>Thursday, May 12 2005</h1>

  <br>

  This evening we're planning for a major release of two new <i>Counter-Strike: Source</i> maps, along with a number of smaller changes to the game. This will be a fairly large download, so it might take a while for you to get all of the new content downloaded. It should be worth the wait.<br>

<br>

  The first of the two maps we'll be adding is a brand new design named de_port, which focuses on giving the two teams a number of initial routes to take in a bomb/diffuse scenario. A couple of weeks ago we sketched out some of our intentions with the map layout, which you can go back and check out <a href="http://steampowered.com/games/css/strategy/">here</a>.<br>

<br>

  The second map we'll be adding to the rotation is a remade de_inferno. As part of our effort to give the community more insight into what we're doing here at Valve, we thought people might find it interesting to see how a map changes over its development cycle. To that end, we've put together a set of screenshots that were taken once each day during de_inferno's development, taken from a variety of camera angles around the map. You can take a look at that <a href="http://steampowered.com/games/css/de_inferno/">here</a>.<br>
