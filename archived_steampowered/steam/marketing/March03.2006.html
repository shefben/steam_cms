	<h1>Friday, March 3 2006</h1><br>

	The <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.empiresmod.com">Empires</a> team is set to release the first version of its Source MOD this weekend, and have put out a giant trailer ahead of the game's launch that you may get off of their site. If playing a game that is a cross between a real-time strategy game and a first person shooter is something you'd be interested in checking out, keep an eye on the Empires <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.empiresmod.com">site</a> this weekend.  <br>

	Meanwhile, the next installment of the popular single player mod Minerva was released today. You may download it over at the official <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.hylobatidae.org/minerva/phosphenes.shtml">site</a>.<br>

	<br>

	We hope people are having fun playing around with the two new Counter-Strike: Source models we released on Wednesday. There is more Counter-Strike: Source content on the way, which we'll be talking about in the next few weeks.    <br>
