	As most of you know, using Steam to get new games is easy. Just browse for something interesting and pretty soon you're saving Darwinians or driving a Russian tank.	But we want it to be even easier for you to decide which games might be right for you, so we've just added an important feature to Steam:<br>
	<img style="margin-bottom:16px;margin-top:16px;" src="March24.2006/img/metacritic.gif"><br>
	Starting today, games available for purchase in the Steam store will display their Metascore&reg; (from <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.metacritic.com">metacritic.com</a>), which is a numeric measure of the game's critical consensus at a glance. The Metascore is created by taking a weighted average of critic grades. We really couldn't think of a more honest, efficient, and independent source of information about game quality. We hope you agree.<br>
	<br>

	By the way! Congratulations to Introversion are in order, because their game <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=8643">Darwinia just won the Grand Prize</a> at this year's Independent Games Festival. Nice work, guys! (Hardly surprising; <a href="steam://store/1500">Darwinia's Metascore is 85</a>!)<br>
