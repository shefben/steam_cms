	<h1>Friday, June 3 2005</h1>

	<br>

	We're happy that the recently released Counter-Strike: Source maps <i>de_inferno</i> and <i>de_port</i> have been so well received, and along those lines it's time to start talking about what's coming next. This week, we have a couple of screenshots from the remake of the classic Counter-Strike map <i>cs_assault</i>, which is now set in downtown Chicago.<br>

	We always like to keep everyone abreast of the games the MOD community is working on, so here is a list of a few we're keeping our eye on:<br>

	<br>

	<a href="http://www.planofattackgame.com/">Plan of Attack</a>, <!-- looks like the hostile planet web site is down :( <a href="http://www.hostile-planet.org">Hostile Planet</a>, --> <a href="http://www.pvkii.com/">Pirates, Vikings, and Knights 2</a>, <a href="http://www.svencoop.com/">Sven Co-Op 2</a>, <a href="http://www.sourceball.com/">Sourceball</a>, and <a href="http://dystopia-mod.com/">Dystopia</a><br>

	<br>

	All of these projects are at varying stages of development, ranging from the concept phase to having a playable game ready for you to download from their site. It's cool to follow a MOD team from their initial concept through the eventual release, as you generally get to see a side of game development that is somewhat hidden with traditional game development companies.<br>
