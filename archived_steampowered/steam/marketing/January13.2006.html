	With the release of the map <i>Militia</i> looming for <a href="steam://store/240">Counter-Strike: Source</a>, we wanted to give the community a sneak peek at what the conversion will look like. As you can see, this new version of Militia is visually a dramatic departure from the previous version. There have also been a few changes to the way the map plays, which should make for some interesting matches.<br>

	We'd also like to point people in the direction of the Dystopia team, who last week did a major release of their popular Source MOD of the same name. Head on over to <a target="_new" href="http://www.dystopia-game.com">the Dystopia website</a> to download their latest version.<br>
