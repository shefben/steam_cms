		<br>
		This week a few of us at Valve have been playtesting the upcoming <nobr>Counter-Strike: Source</nobr> map, cs_compound. The map is still on track for a February release.<br>
		<br>
		Here's a sneak peek:<br>

		If you are involved in building a Mod or Half-Life 2: Deathmatch maps, be sure to check out the updated SDK (available in your Steam games list). About a week ago it was updated to include source files for six Half-Life 2 maps, a new interface for adding bots to mods, and more.<br>
		<br>
		We'll have some news soon on the Half-Life 2: Deathmatch map contest winners, and also on the winners of the Half-Life 2 Gold "VALVE HQ TRIP GIVEAWAY". Stay tuned.<br>
