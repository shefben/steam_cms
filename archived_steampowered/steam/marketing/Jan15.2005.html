		<h1>Friday, January 14th 2005</h1>
		<br>
		We have one more significant release planned for the month of January, which will be focused on Counter-Strike: Source.<br>
		<br>
		<div style="margin-left:24px;">First, we're going to release the Counter-Strike: Source version of the CS Bot. This will be an improved version of the Condition Zero bot, and will be available for all owners of <a href="steam://run/240">Counter-Strike: Source</a>. Right now we're planning this for sometime early the week of the 17th. Also included is a remade version of the Condition Zero map, de_tides, rebuilt by Turtlerock Studios.<br>

		<br>
		Going into February, there will be a release of a new Counter-Strike: Source map by Valve level designer Dave Riller. It's a smaller hostage rescue map with the focus on close quarters fighting. This map is still being play tested, and we're looking forward to seeing what the community thinks of it.<br>
		</div>
		<br>
		There are a number of other things we're working on at Valve right now that we aren't quite ready to talk about, but our resolution for the new year is to keep the community more informed about what's ahead. To that end, there will be a weekly Steam message (like this one) to give people an idea of what we're working on.<br>
