	<b>Day of Defeat Free Weekend</b> was a huge hit last weekend -- thanks to everyone who took part. Thanks also to all the new players who took the time to send us feedback about the experience of playing DoD:S for the first time. As always, we have more in store for the DoD:S community; we're currently working on some pretty interesting new content for the game, which we'll talk about in the coming weeks.<br>

	<i>Red Orchestra: Ostfront 41-45</i> from Tripwire Interactive will debut on Steam next month, and is currently available for pre-purchase and pre-loading. Red Orchestra is a realistic online action game set in the Russian front of WWII that features thirteen scenarios, an arsenal of twenty-four weapons, and fourteen drivable vehicles including tanks and armored transports. In its March 2006 issue, PC Zone UK says Red Orchestra "touts a finely tuned balance of amazing gameplay and surprising realism." <a href="steam://openurl/http://storefront.steampowered.com/video/RedOrchestra_Trailer.wmv">Check out the RO: 41-45 trailer</a> and if the game looks like it's up your alley, go ahead and <a href="steam://preload/1200">preload it now</a>.<br>
