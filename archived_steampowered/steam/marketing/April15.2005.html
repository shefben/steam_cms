		<br>

		We hope everyone is enjoying the Half-Life 2: Deathmatch contest winning maps that were released earlier this week.<br>

		<br>

		The next big Counter-Strike release is set to include two maps. The first map will be de_port, previously mentioned <a href="http://www.steampowered.com/Steam/Marketing/Mar10.2005/">here</a>. This map is set in a resupply port for outgoing ships. The gameplay is designed for a balanced layout employing a mix of long sightlines with cover and close quarters fighting environments. The second map will be a completely redone de_inferno, a historical favorite at CS tournaments and competions. We'll be releasing some screenshots or other media from both of these maps in the next week or two.<br>

		We also promised a sneak peek into work on Half-Life 2: Aftermath. Here is a shot from that, the continuation of Gordon Freeman�s adventures that we'll be releasing as an episode later this summer.<br>
