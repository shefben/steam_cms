	<h1>Friday, September 2 2005</h1>
	<br>
	Day of Defeat: Source will be released this month. While we're not quite ready to pin down the exact date of when it will be available to play, we are confident that it will happen in September. Once we do have an exact date and time for when the game will be activated, we'll let everyone know.<br>
	<br>
	There will be a period of one week at minimum during which people will be able to pre-order and preload the game via Steam, giving them the ability to unlock and play at the moment it is activated.<br>
	<br>
	Day of Defeat: Source will be available as an individual purchase via Steam, as well as part of the Counter-Strike: Source retail package that will be available at stores around the same time. Half-Life 2: Silver and Gold package customers will automatically be able to play.<br>
	<br>
	In the meantime, here are two of the player models from the game -- the Allied Rifleman and the Axis Panzerschreck.<br>
