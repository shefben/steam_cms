	You'll notice some changes in the way Steam looks since the last update. Right now we're working on what we call Steam 3 -- a collection of new features that covers everything from server robustness to support for third-party games. The first major piece we've updated is the organization of the games list and the Steam store. One of our primary goals with this change is to accommodate a larger and more varied collection of games. We hope everyone likes the newer look and feel of Steam.<br>
	<br>
	The next area we're going to be focusing on is the Friends system. As such, Friends will not be available until the overhauled version is released. We will keep you informed of its progress.
	<br>
	<br>Steam, like our games, is something we're always working to evolve. This is the first step in what should be a fun year or so for Steam and the community.<br>
