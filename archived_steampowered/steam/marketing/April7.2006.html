	<img align="left" src="April7.2006/img/JohnBlade.gif" style="margin-right:4px;margin-top:4px;margin-bottom:16px;">It's now possible to <a href="steam://preload/1300">preload your copy of SiN Episode 1: Emergence</a>. As always, pre-loading the game is free, with no obligation. When you pre-load a game on Steam, you receive the full game on your computer in a locked form. Then, if you choose to purchase later, you'll be ready to unlock and play immediately when the game is officially released. Haven't checked out the game, yet? Head over to <a href="steam://openurl/http://sinepisodes.com">the SiN Episodes web site</a>.<br>

	<img align="left" src="April7.2006/img/Alyx.gif" style="margin-right:4px;margin-top:4px;">In other episodic news, today we've launched <a href="steam://openurl/http://ep1.half-life2.com">the official web site of Half-Life 2: Episode One</a>. There you can find screenshots, a trailer, information about the story, and more.<br>

	<br clear="all">

	And finally, we've put together a Day of Defeat: Source "<a href="steam://openurl/http://dayofdefeat.com/stats/">War Status Report</a>" web site showing lots of detailed gameplay statistics. For example, the Axis K98 rifle is most accurate when used at a distance of approximately 58 feet from the target. Might want to choose that weapon next time you find yourself on the Axis side playing Donner (because according to the stats page, the odds are you're going to lose). <br>
