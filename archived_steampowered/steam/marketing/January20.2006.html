	<h1>Friday, January 20 2006</h1><Br>

	It appears that the response to this week's release of the Counter-Strike: Source map <i>Militia</i> has been overwhelmingly positive, and we hope the community is having fun playing it. We're also planning on including two new player models, one from each side, to choose from on each side in the next major Counter-Strike: Source release.<br>

  <br>  

  Next week we'll be releasing the new map for <a href="steam://store/300">Day of Defeat: Source</a>, named <i>Kalt</i>, which we <a href="steam://openurl/http://steampowered.com/Steam/Marketing/January6.2006/">mentioned</a> a couple of weeks ago. Playtesting internally has wrapped up on the map (although we're still playing daily), and we're expecting this sixth map to be one of the more popular releases we've done so far. Also, there will be a Day of Defeat: Source retail box available at software retailers around the start of February. As with all of our games, expect more updates and more content to keep coming.<br>
