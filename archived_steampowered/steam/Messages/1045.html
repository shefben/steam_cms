On Tuesday of this week we released <a href="steam://store/960">a short movie featuring The Heavy</a>, one of the classes you'll be able to play in Team Fortress 2. This particular video was made to showcase some new facial animation technology we've been working on that is enabled by ATI's new HD 2000 series of video cards.<br>

Zombies feature heavily in the news this week. In Source MOD news, the Zombie Master team released an update to their game earlier this week. In <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.zombiemaster.org">Zombie Master</a>, one person gets to control the Zombies while everyone else tries to stop the onslaught. Head over to their website for more info, and to download the current version. Just released this week, <a href="steam://store/7800">Stubbs the Zombie</a> is gleefully eating brains, flinging organs, and creating general mayhem on Steam.<br>
