If you're going to be in the San Jose area next Saturday, you can come by the Showdown LAN event to hear Gabe talk a bit about what we've been up to, get a free copy of Half-Life 2, and most importantly, play Left 4 Dead. This will be the first time we've had this game playable in public, so it should be a lot of fun. You can get <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.showdownlan.com/2007/">more info about the event</a> from their website.<br>
<hr>
In other news, we've recently released (with the help of a number of community volunteers from all over the world) <a href="steam://openurl/http://supportwiki.steampowered.com/">a new support site</a> which is translated into 21 different languages so far.<br>
<hr>
<a href="steam://openurl/http://storefront.steampowered.com/Steam/Marketing/message/1070/img/trackmania.jpg"><img width="180" height="136" align="left" style="margin:0px 12px 8px 0px;" src="message/1070/img/trackmania_thumb.jpg"></a>If flying off mile-high ramps, shooting out over office buildings, and navigating towering loops at break-neck speed is your thing, you'll want to check out <a href="steam://store/7200">Track Mania United</a>. It comes out on Steam on Thursday June 14, and you can preorder the game now for 20% off the release price.<br>
