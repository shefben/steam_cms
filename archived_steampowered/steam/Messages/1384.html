As 2007 comes to a close, just a few days remain to save big on every game on Steam. All titles, from "Best of 2007" contenders to classics, are on sale for 10-50% off through January 1st. The sale includes value-priced collections, so bargain hunters can stock up on dozens of games at a very low price. For example, the <a href="steam://storeurl/?area=package&SubId=478">Valve Complete Pack</a> is now just &#36;74.95--a 25% savings that includes every Valve game offered on Steam, including The Orange Box. That's nearly &#36;200 off the individually-priced collection of games. The <a href="steam://storeurl/?area=package&SubId=585">Strategy First Complete Pack</a> offers 18 great games for just &#36;53.95--a 10% savings over the regular price and a &#36;235 savings over the individually-priced games.<br>
