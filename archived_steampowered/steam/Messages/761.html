We're finally ready to talk in more specific terms about the coming changes to Counter-Strike weapon prices.<br>
<br>
Most of the weapons and equipment in Counter-Strike still have the same prices today as they did when the game was first released. We at Valve know we're not alone in thinking that some of the prices in the game have never been exactly what they should be. (Uh, night-vision?) But rather than tweaking the values ourselves, we thought we'd let you decide. Coming soon in Counter-Strike: Source is a new system that sets the prices of what you can buy based on, well, what people are buying. This means that each week all of the items in Counter-Strike will have different prices based on what people purchase. We've setup <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.steampowered.com/stats/csmarket/">a webpage with more information</a> on how it works, including what the prices will be when we turn this feature on.<br>
<hr>
There is a also big MOD release coming this Saturday, when the <a href="steam://openurl/http://es.spawnpoint.com/splash/">Eternal Silence</a> team releases the first version of their game. We were lucky enough to have their team visit Valve HQ about a month ago and they let us play a pre-release version. The game centers around space combat between huge capital ships bristling with armor and weapons.<br>
<hr>
<img align="left" style="margin-right:16px;" src="message/761/img/RO_thumb.jpg">Lastly, earlier this week the Red Orchestra team released <a href="steam://openurl/http://steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=news&id=752">another significant update</a> to their game, adding a new weapon among a number of other items. <br>
