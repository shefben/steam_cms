Some members of the <a href="steam://store/300">Day of Defeat: Source</a> community have put together a community map collection of three of the most popular third-party maps. The maps, named Coire, Strand, and Vigilance all offer pretty distinctive and unique experiences on their own, and have been play tested and bug proofed by community members over the past several months. This first Community Assembled Map Pack (or C.A.M.P. #1) for DoD: Source will be the first in a series from this group that we'll point out for the community as they are released. If you want to download and check them out, click <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.dayofdefeat.net/forums/announcement.php?f=4">here</a> for the download instructions.<br>
