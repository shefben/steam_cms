For some time now, we've been working on new Steam features that make it a lot easier to play games with friends. This week, we announced <a href="steam://openurl/http://steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=news&id=1093">The Steam Community</a>, bringing the features one step closer to a Steam client near you. Over the next few weeks we'll reveal more details and, in July, the beta version of the Steam Community will give you a chance to explore the features for yourself.<br>

We're cranking away on the Orange Box games and have zeroed in on a release date for Half-Life: Episode Two, Team Fortress 2, and Portal. All three games will be available on the PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 on October 9th. Should be an exciting day.<br>

<a href="steam://store/8400">Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved</a> is now available for Windows XP exclusively on Steam, which means everyone in the office is trying to crack Doug Wood's high score. We should probably all just give up and finish building our own games: clearly, we have our hands full.<br>

New season, new wearables: Just in time for summer, we’ve stocked <a href="steam://openurl/http://store.valvesoftware.com/">the Valve Store</a> with two new t-shirt designs — "Evolution" and "Hand."<br>
