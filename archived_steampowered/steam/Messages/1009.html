Everyone who owns <a href="steam://store/240">Counter-Strike: Source</a> will have a guest pass available to hand out to a friend next week. 
Guest passes allow folks to play the game for free for a few days. So if you've been trying to rope someone 
in to Counter-Strike: Source, now is the perfect time.<hr>

Recently we invited members of the press out to Valve to play Team Fortress 2. Game Informer has published 
a huge story broken up into three parts. You can read <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200703/N07.0326.1849.05812.htm">part one</a>, 
which focuses on the history of Team Fortress.  <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200703/N07.0327.1745.51023.htm">Part two</a>
 is centered around some of the new features people will get to see in Team Fortress 2. <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200703/N07.0328.1722.34101.htm">The third part</a> 


is a write up of Game Informer's play experience based on a match we played with them for about two hours. 
Apparently some people around the office didn't "get the memo" about going easy on the press in the playtest. 
We thought the article might be in jeopardy when our guys playing as spies repeatedly backstabbed the reviewer 
playing as a sniper. Luckily, we showed him how to clean up by placing sentry guns as an engineer... Spy soup 
is best served cold.
