We've released a <a href="steam://openurl/http://steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=game&AppId=944">Left 4 Dead teaser</a> video on Steam, which should give people an idea of what the game feels like to play. Left 4 Dead is a all new co-op game from the team at Turtle Rock which pits you and three companions against a horde of infected citizens.<br>
<br>
We're keeping a close eye on how many guest passes have been redeemed since their release earlier this week, and so far it looks like this feature has been a huge success. Over the coming weeks we'll start adding guest passes to more Steam games. If you own Day of Defeat: Source, then you should now have a guest pass you can grant to a friend, allowing them to play a free trial of the game for a few days.<br>

A note to European Steam users: we'll be adding support for five new languages soon in Steam, Counter-Strike: Source, and Day of Defeat: Source. Those languages are Norwegian, Swedish, Dutch, Danish, and Finnish.<br>
