PC Gamer has given <a href="steam://store/19900">Far Cry 2</a> an "Editor's Choice" rating in their upcoming holiday issue. Their reviewer says "Far Cry 2 hasn’t just exceeded my expectations, it’s blown them away." It's available for pre-purchase now in the Steam store for a &#36;5 discount.<br>
<hr>
<a href="steam://store/500">Left 4 Dead</a>, Valve's new zombie apocalypse simulator, is available for pre-purchase at a 10% discount. We think the game is seriously awesome. Yes, we're a little biased, so maybe you should take our advice with a grain of salt, but if you're going to do that you should also take it with a mouthful of delicious human brains. And then go ahead and pre-purchase the game immediately, because you've been infected with an irresistible desire for more. You don't want to miss out on the co-op, competitive, and single player zombiefest come release day.<br>
<br>
BTW, there's <a href="steam://openurl/http://l4d.com/blog/">a new Left 4 Dead blog</a> up and running. Head over there to see things like German game conventions and undead Lego minifigs getting their brains blown out.<br>
