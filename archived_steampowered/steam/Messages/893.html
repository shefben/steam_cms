Next week, we will release a Steam client update with several new features. The biggest addition will be Guest Passes -- a new feature that lets you give your friends free trial access to your favorite multiplayer games. Also in the update are a streamlined auto-updating mechanism for the Steam client itself, an "add to favorites" feature for the games list, and a new look for the user interface.<br>
<br>
For a more complete description of these new features, you can <a href="steam://openurl/http://storefront.steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=coming_soon">get the full rundown here</a>.<br>

A couple of Mods caught our eye recently. <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.steamgames.com/v/index.php?area=game&AppId=90035">Rock 24</a> is a single-player Half-Life 2 mission in which you (as Gordon Freeman) awake in a prison holding cell and have to rescue a scientist. <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.pvkii.com/">Pirates, Vikings and Knights II</a> has entered beta, with a download available on their website. Try it out and play as <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.pvkii.com/images/players/berserker.jpg">this barrel-chested hairy beast</a>.<br>

Oh yeah, by the way: Happy New Year!<br>
