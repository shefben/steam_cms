For the past month, hundreds of thousands of Steam users have previewed the Steam Community. This week, we dropped the beta tag and officially opened the <a href="steam://url/steamidcontrolpage">Steam Community</a>. Thanks to everyone who joined while the paint was drying, with a bonus jumping high-five to those who provided invaluable comments, bug reports, and feature requests.<br>

Not long ago (in geologic time), we announced the sequel to Team Fortress. We’re thrilled to finally be just days away from unveiling Team Fortress 2. Starting this Monday, September 17, those who <a href="steam://openurl/http://steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=package&SubId=469">pre-purchase the Orange Box on Steam</a> or swing by <a href="steam://openurl/https://cafe.steampowered.com/index.php?area=cafe/directory">a licensed Valve Cyber Cafe</a> can play the beta version of Team Fortress 2.<br>

Many of you have asked for a way to track your stats while playing TF2. Rest assured that no gib will be forgotten: starting Monday, your Steam Community profile will include a detailed breakdown of your TF2 player statistics.
