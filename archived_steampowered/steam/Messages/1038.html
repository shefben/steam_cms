This past week, PCGamer UK and CVG (Computer and Video Games) ran a few stories on our upcoming games. They had nice things to say about their initial impressions of <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=162955">Half-Life 2: Episode Two</a>, <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=162968">Portal</a>, and <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=163472">Team Fortress 2</a>. They also wrote a piece on <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=162953">their trip to Valve</a>, which touches on some upcoming changes to Steam.<br>

Also, beginning today, new and existing owners of <a href="steam://store/2400">The Ship</a> will automatically receive one <a href="steam://openurl/http://support.steampowered.com/cgi-bin/steampowered.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=549&p_created=1164055488">Guest Pass</a>, which lets you invite a friend to play the game for 3 days, free of charge. Please note: if a friend invites you to try The Ship, it's not because they want to share a friendly cruise - it's because they want to sneak up on you in the ship's bathroom & knife you in cold blood.<br>
