We've added a ton of games from Eidos, including all of the Hitman and Commandos games. We offer the games individually and in <a href="steam://openurl/http://steampowered.com/v/index.php?publisher=eidos&cc=US">collection packs</a>. If you purchase any of these games or collections before March 26, you'll receive a 10% discount off the regular price. More Eidos games on the way in coming weeks.<br>

With the update this week to voice communication in Source, we want to point out some of the options out there for headsets. At Valve, we tested using a bunch of <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/products/details/US/EN,CRID=103,CONTENTID=10013">these Logitech headsets</a>. They are fairly inexpensive, easy to set up, and the microphone does a really good job of picking up your voice. Also, once you have your microphone set up, make sure you go into the Voice section of the Options screen to test what you sound like in game.<br>

Silverfall will be released on Steam and at retail on March 20. <a href="steam://store/4420">Check out the demo here</a>, pre-purchase the game now and be ready to play when the game is released.<br>
<br>
Finally, <a href="steam://openurl/http://store.valvesoftware.com/productshowcase/productshowcase_BlackMesaParkingPermitKit.html">Black Mesa windshield parking permits</a> are now available in the store (along with a couple Half-Life themed bumper stickers). The Black Mesa permits are individually numbered, so get them while they last.<br>
