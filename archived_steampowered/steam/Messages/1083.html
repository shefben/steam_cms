<h1>Friday, June 15 2007</h1>

Tomorrow, Saturday June 16th, Valve's Gabe Newell will be giving a presentation at the <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.showdownlan.com/2007/">Showdown LAN 2007</a> event in San Jose. He'll be discussing the Orange Box release and some new developments in Steam. But the part of the event we're looking forward to most is Left 4 Dead being playable by real gamers for the first time. Judging by our own internal playtests, the co-op nature of the game will make for some intense (and hilarious) LAN play. Note to those attending the event: Gabe tends to accidentally shoot teammates, so stand behind him while fighting the zombie horde.<br>

"Egos. Money. Blockbusters. Welcome to Hollywood."<br>
