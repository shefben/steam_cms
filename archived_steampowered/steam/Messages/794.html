<h1>Friday, October 20 2006</h1>
<br>
There is now less than a week to get Dark Messiah of Might and Magic preloaded to your computer and ready for its launch next week. If you're in North America, the game will be playable on October 25th at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time. For the rest of the world, you'll be able to play on the 27th at 10:00 a.m. GMT.<br>
<br>
Dark Messiah takes place in an incredibly rich and detailed world, and as a result is five times larger than Half-Life 2, weighing in at 10GB. If you <a href="steam://preload/2100">preload the game now</a> or <a href="steam://store/2100">purchase now</a>, you'll be able to play immediately when the game is released.<br>
<br>
<img align="left" style="margin:0px 16px 4px 0px;" src="message/794/img/DM_skin.jpg">Also, check out the new Dark Messiah Steam skin! To use it, <a href="steam://settings/interface">open the Steam Settings window</a> and select it from the list of skins.<br>
<br clear="all">
<hr>
The team at Introversion released an update for all <a href="steam://store/1520">Defcon</a> players earlier this week, which includes a newer version of their server browser. Getting in and playing a game of Defcon is a lot easier now. <br>
