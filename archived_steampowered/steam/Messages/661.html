As part of Valve's continuing effort to build better games, we have traditionally relied on things like written feedback from players to help decide which improvements to focus on. More recently, Steam has allowed us to collect new kinds of information. Episode One includes a reporting mechanism that tells us about how people are playing the game. We're sharing the <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.steampowered.com/stats/ep1/">EP1 gameplay stats data</a> because we think people will find it interesting, and because we expect to spot emergent problems earlier, and ultimately build better products and experiences as a result. <a href="steam://openurl/http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?s=&forumid=69">Let us know</a> what you think.<br>
