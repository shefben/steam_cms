Thousands of computer graphics pros migrated to the annual SIGGRAPH convention last week, where artist-in-residence Jason Mitchell gave a presentation on TF2's unique art style. If you're interested in the technical or artistic choices that go into game development, <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.valvesoftware.com/publications/2007/NPAR2007_IllustrativeRenderingInTeamFortress2.wmv">watch the movie</a> (.wmv, 75MB) that Jason showed during his talk. If you're not afraid of formulas and technical-speak, you can even read the white paper, "<a href="steam://openurl/http://www.valvesoftware.com/publications/2007/NPAR07_IllustrativeRenderingInTeamFortress2.pdf">Illustrative Rendering in Team Fortress 2</a>." (pdf)<br>

As you know, <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=agegate&AppId=7670">BioShock</a> will be available on Steam next Tuesday in the US, next Friday in Europe. You can beat the stampede to nab the game by pre-loading it today. At 1pm PST, the game will automatically activate and the rest of your life will fall by the wayside. Based on <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/pc/bioshock?q=bioshock">early reviews</a>, we're as excited as the rest of the global gaming community to play it. <br>
