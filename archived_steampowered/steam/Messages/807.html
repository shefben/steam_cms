<h1>Friday, October 27 2006</h1>

We released what should be the final update to the <a href="steam://store/240">Counter-Strike: Source</a> weapon pricing beta. Assuming that everything runs well over the weekend, we'll be rolling this update out to everyone this coming Wednesday the 1st of November. All of the prices will start at their default values, with the first price correction happening Monday, November 6th.<br>
<hr>
Tripwire, the team behind <a href="steam://store/1200">Red Orchestra</a>, is also working on a huge update that will be rolling out shortly. Some of the highlights are two brand new vehicles along with a new map. Fans of the game should get the update in the next week or so. <br>

In other news, a gateway from another dimension (called Halloween) has opened here in the Valve office, today. The Zombine at left is the least scary of <a href="steam://openurl/http://storefront.steampowered.com/Steam/Marketing/message/807/img/Creatures.jpg">all the creatures</a> currently roaming our halls.
