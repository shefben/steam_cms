This week we can tell you about a big release coming soon to Steam for Tripwire's <a href="steam://store/1200">Red Orchestra: Ostfront 41-45</a>. Given RO's continuously growing community, Tripwire recently ran a community map contest and will be publishing over ten new maps from the winners in a few weeks time. The pack not only features maps with quality artwork and gameplay, but also adds some great community made features to the game such as new vehicles and player controlled anti-tank cannons. <br />
