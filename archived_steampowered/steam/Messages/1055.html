In Source MOD news, it looks like the Insurgency team is getting close to releasing the first version of their game. From the beginning, this looked like one of the more interesting and ambitious MODs in development, and the screenshots look absolutely stunning. They are planning on shipping sometime next month, head over to <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.insmod.net/">their site</a> to tell them to hurry up.<br>
