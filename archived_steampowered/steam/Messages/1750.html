Early next week, we'll be shipping a new (huge!) update for Team Fortress 2. In addition to three unlockable weapons and thirty-five achievements for the Heavy, we've got a new game mode with five new arenas, a new Payload map focusing on more open spaces than Goldrush, and another popular community-made map. <a href="steam://openurl/http://steamgames.com/tf2/heavy/">Check out this site for details</a>.<br>
