We've brought a lot of new games to Steam this week. Seems like there's something for everyone. If you didn’t get a chance to play <a href="steam://store/6910">Deus Ex</a> when it was first released, you missed something great. Don’t let its age discourage you--it’s a classic. Similarly, <a href="steam://store/6980">Thief: Deadly Shadows</a> is not to be overlooked; this is the one we're re-playing at the office right now. Sneak up and render an innocent housekeeper unconscious with a whack of your blackjack. It's good to be a Thief!<br>

See the rest of <a href="steam://publisher/eidos">the new Eidos offerings</a>, including Tomb Raider: Legend, Project Snowblind, and Rogue Trooper. Gives you something to do this weekend between NCAA basketball games. Or ICC Cricket World Cup games. We're betting against Australia, by the way.<br>
