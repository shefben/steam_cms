This week, the <a href="steam://store/300">Day of Defeat: Source</a> team released the <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.dayofdefeat.net/forums/announcement.php?f=4">CAMP2 Pack</a>, brought to you by the Community Assembled Map Project (CAMP). This pack includes some of the top custom DoD maps available today (including a brand new one), representing a nice cross-section of play styles and themes. And to celebrate, we’ve lowered the price of Day of Defeat: Source to just $9.95.<br>

We're headed to QuakeCon 2007 next week. If you're one of the 7,000+ lucky attendees, be sure to stop by booth 221 to say hi and play a few rounds of Left 4 Dead. Valve and the Turtle Rock Studios design team will be on hand to answer questions about the game. We're giving away some cool schwag, too. Next week, we'll fill you in our visit to the show. <br>
