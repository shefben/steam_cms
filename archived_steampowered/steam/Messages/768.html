Introversion's latest game, <a href="steam://store/1520">DEFCON</a>, is now available for play. DEFCON pits global superpowers against each other in all-out thermonuclear war. It's always fun to wipe out your friend in Counter-Strike, but in DEFCON you get to nuke his whole continent off the map. Pwned with kiloton yields.<br>
