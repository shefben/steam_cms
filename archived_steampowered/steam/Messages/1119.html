<h1>Friday, July 6, 2007</h1>
A few of us around the office took some time playing the recently released <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.insurgencymod.net/home">Insurgency MOD</a>, which has vaulted into the lead in terms of player numbers for any third party modification. For those of us that played for an hour or two we thought there was a ton of polish for a first release, and a lot of potential around the core of the game in the long term. If you haven't yet, head over to the Insurgency site to <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.insurgencymod.net/downloads">download</a> the first beta release and get playing.<img src="message/1119/img/insurgency.jpg">
