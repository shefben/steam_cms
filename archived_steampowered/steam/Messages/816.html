This past week we played host to a number of editors from the hardware press to share our plan for taking advantage of multicore CPUs in the next few months. <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.bit-tech.net/gaming/2006/11/02/Multi_core_in_the_Source_Engin/1.html">Bit-Tech</a> and <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1697,2050563,00.asp">ExtremeTech</a> have posted their recap of the event so far, and there should be stories showing up at other outlets over the next few weeks.

The Ship is currently running a free weekend, where you can play the full game from now until this Sunday at 1:00 p.m. PDT. There are thousands of people playing as part of the trial right now, so <a href="steam://openurl/http://steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=TheShipFreeWeekend">click here to find out if this is the game for you</a>.

The holidays also appear to have come early here at Valve, where the team at Taito has delivered to us our very own Half-Life 2: Survivor arcade machine. Most of us are enjoying the game immensely. But earlier today, Robin Walker took a break from working on Team Fortress 2 to play HL2 Survivor -- his game ended almost immediately, and he blamed his crushing defeat on the game's lack of a mouse and keyboard. We just thought you should know.<br>
