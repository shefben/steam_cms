<a href="steam://store/500">Left 4 Dead</a> has been <a href="steam://openurl/http://exiledonline.com/review-be-a-zombie-suck-human-brains-in-left-4-dead/">written up on The Exile</a> (a Moscow-based newspaper, also home to Gary Brecher's blog <a href="steam://openurl/http://exiledonline.com/?s=war+nerd">The War Nerd</a>). Their take on L4D starts off strong: "What is a zombie piñata? It’s when a zombie on a rooftop fires its tongue down at a victim, picks her up and and dangles her above the undead horde, which take turns clawing little pieces of meat candy out of her." Mmm. Meat candy.<br>
