<br>It's been one week since we officially launched <a href="steam://openurl/http://ep1.half-life2.com">Half-Life 2: Episode One</a>. So far <a href="steam://openurl/http://ep1.half-life2.com/reviews.php">the critical response</a> has been great. The feedback we value most highly, though, is the kind we get from players. Between email, bug reports, forum posts, and wiki contributions, we've already gotten a good idea of which elements of the game worked best, and how to make <a href="steam://store/916">Episode Two</a> even better.<br clear="all">
