Seeing a new community emerge around an upcoming game is always pretty exciting for us. A couple of weeks ago we hosted the guys behind Left 4 Dead's first fansite, <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.left4dead411.com/">Left 4 Dead 411</a>. They've since posted <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.left4dead411.com/left-4-dead-preview-trip.php">their first installment</a> of two huge articles from their experience playing the game.<br>

Don't forget to hand out your guest passes to friends if you're a Counter-Strike: Source owner. To see if you have a guest pass available just look next to the game's name in the Steam games list. The recipient of the guest pass doesn't need to have Steam installed; you can send the pass by entering an e-mail address and it'll guide them though the process.<br>
