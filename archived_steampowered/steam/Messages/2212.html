School buses with nitro rockets now on Steam.  Check out <a href="steam://store/16620">Monster Trucks Nitro</a>, the latest game from Red Lynx, the makers of Trials 2. <a href="steam://store/5184">This video</a> says it all.<br>
<hr>
There is also <a href="steam://store/5188">a new trailer</a> showing off some of the multiplayer functionality in the much anticipated <a href="steam://store/10500">Empire: Total War</a> from Sega and Creative Assembly.<br>
<hr>
<a href="steam://store/13210"><img align="left" style="margin:4px 12px 12px 0px;" src="message/2212/img/UT3.jpg"></a>Steam now accepts retail keys from <a href="steam://store/13210">Unreal Tournament 3</a>. There’s a massive update for Unreal Tournament 3 on the way from Epic and you can get ready for it by either buying UT3 or <a href="steam://open/registerproduct">activating a product key you already have</a>. UT3 will be updated automatically via Steam and introduce support for Steamworks Achievements (with over 50 Achievements), plus a host of new features and enhancements in AI, Server Browsing, Demo Recording, Mod Support, and more.<br>
<hr>
Lastly, we opened up <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.youtube.com/valve">our official YouTube channel</a>. Right now it features the TF2 Meet the Team shorts. We’ll continue to post more content up; take a look and see what you think.<br>
