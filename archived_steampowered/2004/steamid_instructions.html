<h1>How to find your Steam User ID</h1>

	Your Steam ID is your unique numeric identifier. It is the piece of identification that Steam uses to determine which games you own, whether you've ever cheated on a public game server, etc.<br/><br/>
	If you don't know your Steam ID, here's how to find it:<br/><br/>
	You must first connect to an internet game server. (If you've been banned by VAC for cheating, you'll have to find an "insecure" server for this purpose). After you're connected, open the console by pressing the tilde (~) key. In the console, type "status" (without quotes). Look for your own player name, and note the number that follows it. This is your official Steam ID.<br/>
