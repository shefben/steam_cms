<p align="center"><textarea cols="94" name="EULA" rows="14" style="border-style: double; border-width: 7">By clicking on the "I Agree" button below, you agree to be bound by the terms of this STEAM GAME PLAYER AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") with Valve, L.L.C. ("Valve"), in exchange for the license provided hereunder.   If you do not agree, click "I Do Not Agree," and the referenced software will not install and you will not be given access to STEAM.  This is a legal agreement between you and Valve.

1.	Evaluation Software.  This Agreement describes your rights to access and utilize Steam including, without limitation, broadband-accessible versions of Half-Life, Counter-Strike, Team Fortress Classic and other broadband-accessible software that Valve may make available to you (collectively, the "Evaluation Software"), for the sole purpose of testing and evaluating a pre-release version of the Evaluation Software, including any and all software components thereof, whether installed locally on your personal computer or accessed over the Internet.

2.	Grant of Evaluation License.  Valve grants to you a royalty-free, non-exclusive, terminable, worldwide, nontransferable license during the term of this Agreement to access and play the Evaluation Software, and to download and install the client-side components of the Evaluation Software, for purposes of evaluation and testing only.

3.	Restrictions on Use.  You will not rent, transfer, or lease the Evaluation Software to any other party for any reason.  You will not translate, modify, reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Evaluation Software for any reason whatsoever.  This restriction includes, but is not limited to, any actions taken for the purpose of "debugging" or otherwise improving or modifying the Evaluation Software.

4.	Feedback.  You agree to provide Feedback (as defined below) to Valve regarding the Evaluation Software, by (i) answering certain questions that will appear during your use of the Evaluation Software, (ii) responding to occasional emails from Valve, and (iii) answering questions via a Web page to which Valve may direct you.  "Feedback" means any and all suggestions, comments, ideas, responses to questions, or other information that you provide to Valve regarding the Evaluation Software.  If you fail to provide Feedback, Valve may terminate this Agreement and your access to the Evaluation Software, pursuant to Section 9.  You agree that Valve will be free to use and implement any Feedback or suggestions that you provide to Valve regarding the Evaluation Software or any other Valve software product.

5.	Confidential Information.  You acknowledge that, as a player of the pre-release version of STEAM, you have received or may receive Confidential Information (as defined below) belonging to Valve.  You will not use this Confidential Information for any purpose, other than to test and provide Feedback regarding the Evaluation Software.  You will not disclose Confidential Information to third parties without Valve's prior written consent.  Specifically, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you agree not to discuss with any third party the game design, gameplay, functionality, graphical elements, or any other element of the Evaluation Software.  "Confidential Information" means nonpublic information arising out of, related to or disclosed pursuant to this Agreement and includes, without limitation, the Evaluation Software, Feedback, and any other information relating to the Steam Beta Test.  Confidential Information does not include information that: (i) is or becomes generally known or available by publication, commercial use or otherwise through no fault of your own; (ii) is rightfully known by you prior to the time of disclosure and is not subject to restriction; (iii) became known to you from a source other than Valve other than by the breach of an obligation of confidentiality owed to Valve; or (iv) is independently developed by you without the use of Confidential Information.

6.	NO VALVE WARRANTY.  YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE EVALUATION SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, "WITH ALL FAULTS," AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTY THAT THE SOFTWARE IS FREE OF ERRORS OR VIRUSES.  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, VALVE DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, ACCURACY OF INFORMATION, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT AND ANY DUTIES OF REASONABLE CARE, WORKMANLIKE EFFORT OR LACK OF NEGLIGENCE.

7.	NO LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER DAMAGES.  IN NO EVENT SHALL VALVE OR COMPANIES PROVIDING HOSTING SERVICES FOR THE EVALUATION SOFTWARE BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, OR ANY OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF VALVE OR COMPANIES PROVIDING HOSTING SERVICES FOR THE EVALUATION SOFTWARE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

8.	Technical Support.  Valve has no obligation to provide technical support with regard to the Evaluation Software.

9.	Personal Information.  You agree that your submission of personal information to Valve, and Valve's collection and use of such information will be subject to the terms of Valve's Privacy Policy, which is available at http://www.valvesoftware.com/privacy.htm, and is incorporated herein by reference.  Specifically, and without limitation, you agree that providing requested personal information is a requirement to play Steam and that Valve may, in its sole discretion and as necessary to successfully test the Evaluation Software, make this personal information accessible to companies that provide hosting services for Steam.

10.	Term and Termination.  This Agreement will be effective immediately upon you clicking the "I Agree" button below and will continue in effect until terminated by Valve.  Valve may terminate this Agreement with or without cause upon notice to you.

11.	Effect of Termination or Expiration.  As of the date on which this Agreement is terminated or expires, the license granted under Section 2 will expire.  Sections 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12 and 13 of this Agreement will survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.

12.	Severability.  If any provision of this Agreement shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

13.	Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Venue.  This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Washington.  You submit and consent to jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts sitting in King County, Washington.
