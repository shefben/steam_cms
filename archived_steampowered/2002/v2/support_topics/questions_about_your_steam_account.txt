									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><b>Why did the login fail after I entered my user name and offer key?<br>
											</b>The login screen requires you to enter your user name and password. During your account creation, you were asked to enter an email address, which you will use as your user name when logging in to the Steam application, a password, which you will use as your password when logging in to the Steam application, and a special offer key. The special offer key is used only during this registration process.<br>

											</b>Contact the support team by email and we will issue a new password. Email <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021015103215/mailto: steamsupport@valvesoftware.com">steamsupport@valvesoftware.com</a>.<br>
