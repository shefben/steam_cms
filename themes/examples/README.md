# Theme Configuration Examples

Two sample `theme.json` files demonstrate how themes can extend the admin UI:

- **simple_theme** – adds a single text field stored in the `settings` table.
- **complex_theme** – showcases multiple widgets, page targeting, placement
  with `target`/`position`, and saving to custom tables with explicit
  `datatype` hints.

Copy one of these directories next to your theme and adjust values as needed.
