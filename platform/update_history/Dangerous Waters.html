Changes/Additions<hr align="left"><ul><li> Added variable in "dangerouswaters.ini" which controls the likelihood of torpedos exploding 
  on countermeasures (e.g. ".PercentTorpsExplodeOnCM 0" up to ".PercentTorpsExplodeOnCM 100"). 
  In multi-player matches, the host's .INI setting will be used by all players. By default 
  the value is set to ".PercentTorpsExplodeOnCM 50".</li>
<li> Added variable in "dangerouswaters.ini" which controls the likelihood of all weapons acquiring 
  dead/sinking platforms (e.g. ".PercentDeadPlatformsIgnored 0" up to ".PercentDeadPlatformsIgnored 100").   
  In multi-player matches, the host's .INI setting will be used by all players. By default 
  the value is set to ".PercentDeadPlatformsIgnored 10".</li>
<li> Updated MH-60 model and AQS-22 on Dipping Sonar (addressed the reversed normals issue 
  which was causing issues with the self-shadowing paradigm).</li>
<li> Updated the Freighter model and textures with the one used in the Steam trailer</li>
<li> Updated FFG model and textures</li>
<li> Updated 688(I) model, textures, and masts</li>
<li> Strike missiles were modified so that their approach angles yielded a more effective result 
  against their respective land targets</li>
<li> Addressed torpedo anomaly which caused the torpedos to not behave as expected</li>
<li> Refined the buoyancy model to allow a more stable ascent and descent in the submarines 
  and to allow them to maintain their depth without unnecessary oscillation</li>
<li> The Akula Towed Array should no longer be accidentally severed by the propeller</li>
<li> Fixed speed/pitch issues on the FFG when player issues hard rudder orders</li>
<li> Corrected a pathfinding issue fixed which could sometimes cause the game to crash if
  a waypoint was deemed to be incorrect or unreachable by the algorithm</li>
<li> QuickRepair and QuickAircraftLaunch now controlled correctly in multiplayer</li>
</ul>Bug fixes<hr align="left"><ul><li> Corrected an issue in which the Kilo was capable of creating Sonar contacts at excessively long ranges</li>
<li> Fixed an issue in which AI aircraft were not dropping contacts when they had lost sensor contact</li>
<li> Modified buoyancy model so that ships do not rock excessively at Sea State 1</li>
<li> Fixed crash when launching the DSRV from submarine platforms</li>
<li> Corrected AI aircraft order persistence, which makes them more decisive during attacks</li>
<li> Fixed issue in which passive self-noise was being considered by active sensors</li>
<li> Torpedo speed vs. fuel issue was corrected</li>
<li> Corrected an issue which prohibited "nested tactics at waypoints" from being invoked properly</li>
<li> Fixed a crash in the Towed Array station on the FFG</li>
</ul>
