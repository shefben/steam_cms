Changes/Additions<hr align="left"><ul><li> ·This is mostly a performance enhancement version
oClient and server CPU performance improvments have been applied
oRendering improvments: Overall framerate should be somewhat higher
oLess server CPU spiking (should lead to less server lag)</li>
<li> ·Necessary bandwidth further reduced</li>
<li> ·Many overlapping sounds were reduced to one at a time</li>
<li> ·Network code altered in an attempt to smooth experience</li>
<li> ·Disruptors given more updates</li>

<div id="August 09, 2007" style="display: none; padding-left: 32px">
Changes/Additions<hr align="left"><ul><li> ·There is a new ‘Chat’ button in Starport which lets you chat directly with the rest of the Starport community.</li>
<li> ·When connected to a game, you can use the new chat screen to invite everyone to join the game you’re in.  All they have to do is click on your invite and they will automatically join you.</li>
<li> ·A new command-line parameter “-windowed” has been added to force the game to run in a window.</li>
<li> ·The ThreadSpace: Hyperbol Map Registration page is now open and in Beta.  Map authors can use this page to submit their completed, polished maps to be considered to be made into ‘Official’ maps for the purpose of scoring exp and credits on.  You can find this Page in Starport, in the bottom navigation menu.</li>
<li> ·A new command-line parameter “-connect” (or +connect) has been added.  This will automatically log into Starport, select your most recently-used character, and then connect to the host or IP you supply after the –connect command</li>
<li> ·Many physics and rendering optimizations have been applied.  The game should run smoother than ever.</li>
<li> ·The bandwidth usage has been further optimized.  Servers should see less bandwidth usage across the board.  This could lead to improved latencies (ping), and less desynchs.</li>

<li> ·Special Effects for Repair Drones, Upgraded Hyperbol, and Hyperplasm have been optimized.</li>
<li> ·Blur and glow rendering has been tweaked with for less of a washed-out look.</li>
<li> ·Mining Facility altered again.</li>

<li> ·Det Bomb mass and build speed decreased</li>
<li> ·Time Bomb mass and damage decreased</li>
<li> ·Pulse Cannon armor slightly decreased</li>
<li> ·Fighter Swarm damage increased</li>

Changes/Additions<hr align="left"><ul><li> ·A slowdown that occurred when multiple ‘floors’ were in the same map and blur was turned on has been fixed.

<li> ·Some typos fixed</li>
<li> ·Chat text and voice tags should now show up in the color of your team instead of always green.</li>

<li> ·You can now hold CTRL and press the go to ship key (Default is V) to lock onto your ship and follow it around automatically (Camera follow mode).  Pressing it again will unlock.</li>
<li> ·The Training Bot has been improved (higher skill level)</li>
<li> ·The ‘go to ship key’ (Default is V) has been raised up and has a better view of the overall field.</li>
<li> ·An additional command line option has been added for low end machines to offload some of the physics work to the server they’re connected to.  The command line argument is –cheapphysics</li>

<li> ·Starport now has a standard Terms of Service agreement when you first log in.  This agreement will only appear until you accept it.  It will reappear if it has changed, so when you see it, read it carefully.</li>

o–adapter <n> (override the graphics adapter index)
o–noredists (will not run the redists at all – good for linux users)</li>
<li> ·Slightly reduced the stat bonus from building multiple Ballistic modules</li>
<li> ·Decreased the mass of rockets</li>
<li> ·Increased the ejection speed of cluster shards</li>
<li> ·Decreased the damage of cluster shards</li>

<div id="July 19, 2007" style="display: none; padding-left: 32px">
Changes/Additions<hr align="left"><ul><li> ·Forced Team Balance has been enabled by default.  Server ops can still disable this feature (not recommended).  When on, players will be sorted into teams using a smart algorithm based on skill level of their account (not their character).  Note that once you have been placed on a team, you can still leave and switch with someone – if someone is willing to do the same.  Or you can observe and wait for another person to fill that other lopsided slot if you wish.</li>
<li> ·Training is now a Team Elimination type game, with faster resurface time after being destroyed.</li>
<li> ·In Official Training servers (only), a bot will join to fill a slot if any team imbalance occurs.  He will leave once the teams are balanced again (as long as a teammate is alive).</li>
<li> The Refer-A-Friend feature has been implemented.  See the http://Starport.Hyperbol.com for promotional details.  Two new unique ship skins were created as part of the promotion – they are not recolors of existing skins.  They use shiny / glossy shaders, too.  Good luck!</li>
<li> Official Deathmatch servers now MUST choose a specific skill bracket.  In other words, you may no longer host an ‘open’ deathmatch server, but instead, must pick a skill bracket.  Available brackets are novice or Pro.</li>
<li> Trainee skill rating is reserved for the Training gametype only.</li>
<li> Several maps have had their surface beacon and surface locations changed to better support flow and capture.</li>
<li> Surface beacons now take less time to capture, and some have a larger capture radius.</li>
<li> Laser turret in mining facility can no longer be repaired once destroyed.</li>
<li> Production Station Modules now build about 3x faster!</li>
<li> 5v6, 6v7, and 7v8 is now allowed in team games, without stopping the extra person from being able to play.</li>
<li> Ship Kills are still awarded on the basis of who did the most damage, but now it only counts recent damage – about a 30 second window before damage dealt by a target is cleared.</li>
<li> You no longer stop moving / cancel your move, if you run into friendly repulsors, attractors, and repair drones.  You bounce off them and continue going.</li>
</ul>Bug fixes<hr align="left"><ul><li> Some minor memory leaks found and fixed during map loading</li>
<li> Some minor memory leaks found and fixed during console command execution</li>
<li> Destroying a turret or other destroyable object should no longer result in brief lag.</li>
<li> Fixed a very rare crash on game load (at about 3% loading, in the loading screen)</li>
<li> Auto-downloading of custom maps from servers properly configured now works.  Please see the wiki at http://wiki.hyperbol.com for additional details.</li>
