<li> New camouflage skins for all camouflaged German tanks and enhanced skins for the snow versions of all Russian tanks</li>
<li> Many modifications/improvements to the infantry carried machine gun functionality. MGs are now quite a bit more accurate, with less recoil. MG34 single fire mode is much more accurate</li>

<li> Tweaks to the vehicle hit detection system to more precisely determine which side a shell hits the tank on</li>
<li> Updated smoke grenade effect (has a bit more "motion")</li>

</ul>Bug fixes<hr align="left"><ul><li> Fixed the tank cannons firing blanks under certain lag related conditions</li>

<li> Fixed an issue where there would be a lot of chugging, stuttering, and hard drive caching when first walking around a map, even when precaching was on. NOTE: This change only affects users who have precaching enabled. Basically, texture and geometry precaching was not working properly</li>

<li> Fixed German hull MGs having an incorrect ROF (600 RPM instead of 850 RPM)</li>

Changes/Additions<hr align="left"><ul><li> Added the German G41 Semi Automatic Rifle</li>
<li> All new Russian voice commands</li>
<li> Improved jogging animations for the players</li>
<li> New ammo pickup system. Ammo is now dropped as belts or pouches which contain all of the ammo held for a particular weapon. This replaces dropping lots of individual ammo magazines which was cumbersome and made it difficult to choose what the player wanted to pickup</li>
<li> Player ragdolls are now affected by explosions from grenades, artillery, and HE rounds</li>
<li> New weapon pickup system. The player will now automatically drop their current weapon when attempting to pick up a weapon of the same weapon family (small arms for small arms, nades for nades, etc)</li>
<li> Added an option to use the native (non-translated) role names which we had in previous releases. Under Configuration->Hud check the "Use Native Role Names" box to enable this feature</li>

<li> Rendering optimizations for Lyes Krovy</li>
<li> If a player attempts to mark an artillery position on a level where there is no artillery   for their team they will now receive a message letting them know that their is no artillery available. This makes it clearer for new players why they can't call in arty on some maps</li>
<li> Players that are not commanders will no longer get "Press Use To Call Arty" messages from artillery radios</li>
<li> PTRD Soldiers (PT Soldat) now get binoculars to assist in spotting long range targets</li>
<li> Made the STG44 fire animations appear smoother</li>
</ul>Bug fixes<hr align="left"><ul><li> Fixed dead players turning black before disappearing</li>
<li> Fixed a bug where the Unit Descriptions weren't being displayed online</li>
<li> Fixed localization (non-English text) not working properly with objective names and descriptions</li>
<li> Fixed a bug where artillery radios that were able to be used by either team would not show up on the overhead map</li>
<li> Fixed various map related bugs</li>
<li> Fixed the TC Mod ini file being named "UT2k4Mod.ini". The file should now be called ROMod.ini</li>
<li> Fixed a bug where you could not set rally points or mark artillery positions with binoculars in the commander seat of the T34/76</li>
<li> Fixed an animation issue with the STG44 and the MG34 where they would appear to "jerk" if the fire button was held down longer than the fire animation</li>
<li> Fixed an exploit where the iron sight animation could be frozen in place on semi automatic weapons or semi auto fire modes</li>
<li> Fixed a bug where if you fired the coaxial MG on a tank turret until it reloaded after your primary ammo was out, it would instantly consume all of your coaxial MG ammo</li>
<li> Fixed a bug where weapons and ammo would be picked up automatically if you were touching them when they disappeared</li>
<li> Fixed a bug where if you dropped a weapon while you had a weapon on your back, the weapon would remain showing on your back, even though it was actually in your hands</li>
<li> Fixed a collision issue where you could fire a tank shell through the lower part of the Panther's turret and it would pass right through without doing any damage</li>
<li> Fixed a bug where you could get in "invisible" bayonet if trying to mount the bayonet during charging the butt smack</li>
<li> Fixed various bayonet exploits</li>
<li> Fixed an exploit where you could instantly mount/dismount a bayonet by pressing the bayo attach button while changing weapons</li>
<li> Fixed a problem where the team channel selection button would not work in the French language version. (Note, delete the user.ini file to regenerate a fixed one)</li>

<div id="July 27, 2006" style="display: none; padding-left: 32px">
Changes/Additions<hr align="left"><ul><li> LvesKrovy – new infantry map featuring close quarters combat in a trench and forest environment</li>
<li> Smoke Grenades for both German and Russian commanders</li>
<li> Streamlined and enhanced some interface functionality to make it easier for new players to get into the game</li>
<li> Merged in the UT2004 3369 optimizations to improve server and client CPU performance</li>
<li> New tank cannon round switching system – this new system allows you to select the next round that will be loaded after you fire off the current round. This system more closely matches the real functionality of the tank cannons/ammunition of the period, as well as eliminating the “double reload time” issue where the player had to wait until the current round type was reloaded before switching to another round type after firing</li>
<li> New win conditions (removing “No Decisive Victory”) – this feature change was requested by many players and clans/ladders/leagues. Rounds will no longer end in a stalemate if the time runs out before either side captures all objectives. Instead, the game will assign a winner based by evaluating the following set of criteria in order: which side holds the most objectives, which side has the higher total score, and which team has the most reinforcements</li>
<li> The scoreboard has been enhanced with additional information included a total team score, total objectives held by each team, and the round time remaining</li>
<li> The objective map now breaks out the primary (required) objectives from the secondary objectives to make it more clear what the players should be attacking/defending</li>
<li> Changed the chat text color so that it will be more easily readable against more difficult background colors</li>
<li> Tracers now start at the tip of the 3rd person weapon instead of appearing to come out of the players head</li>
<li> Improved the 3rd person upper body movement while prone. The upper body will now be able to adapt better to terrain while prone helping prevent many of the times when 3rd person players would appear to be aiming up in the air in 3rd person while they were aiming straight forward in first person</li>
<li> The 3rd person players now much more closely match where the first person player is aiming in regard to the pitch axis</li>
</ul>Bug fixes<hr align="left"><ul><li> New default sound driver from Creative Labs that should fix the issue of having choppy VOIP while using the Hardware 3d or EAX sound setting</li>
<li> Fixed players bouncing off of other players that were prone (This was making it very difficult to perform melee attacks on prone players)</li>
<li> Fixed a problem where you could get telefragged by proning/unproning and crouching/uncrouching players</li>
<li> Fixed a graphical glitch that would cause red squares on terrain where blood had splattered</li>
<li> Fixed an exploit where commanders could call in artillery strikes on a position that they marked in a previous round</li>
<li> Fixed a bug where changing stances or starting to crawl while switching to nades  could cause the grenades to get stuck unable to fire</li>
<li> Fixed players being able to move thier view around for a short time after dieing when the bSpectateLockedBehindView or the  bSpectateFirstPersonOnly flag are set on the server</li>
<li> Fixed players being able to switch their view to third person view while dieing when the bSpectateFirstPersonOnly flag is set on the server</li>
<li> Fixed players being able to fly around the map while dead under rare circumstances when the bSpectateAllowRoaming is set to false</li>
