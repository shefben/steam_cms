For those server admins who have trouble with the Steam HLDS update tool, or have trouble getting the dedicated server update through Steam, here are the changed files.<br>
<br>
<h3 style="text-transform:uppercase;">March 23rd (CS:CZ) Release</h3>
NOTE: This release includes only those files which have changed since the last dedicated server release. This download is an update only -- it requires that you have a Half-Life dedicated game server already installed. If you're looking for the full dedicated server Steam installer, you can find it on the <a href="/?area=getsteamnow">Get Steam Now</a> page (towards the bottom).<br><br>

<!--

To save file size, we've created seperate downloads for each game. In this case, the Day of Defeat server update is larger than the others.<br><br>
