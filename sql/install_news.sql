After this, you will need to have a valid CD-Key to access games via Steam, so you will want to treat your Steam account as permanent. One CD-Key will grant you access to all of the games currently available in the Steam beta. The Friends database will remain intact, so if you create an account with the same name when the beta ends, you will retain your Friends list.<br/><br/>The next step will be to release the remaining three Half-Life 2 movies, fix the remaining issues with the Riot Shield in Counter-Strike, and any remaining issues with Steam. This will happen almost immediately after the Steam beta ends.<br/><br/>Some of the other features coming after the beta resets are:<br/><br/><ul style="padding-bottom: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><li> New version of Cobble reworked by David Johnston.<br/><li> Full Skin support in Steam.<br/><li> More detailed information regarding the cache file on your drive.<br/><li> Vastly more efficient use of disk space and bandwidth in Steam.<br/><li> New conversion wizard to make better use of existing content on your drive.</li></li></li></li></li></ul><br/>After this, we''ll release an update to the entire user base that will convert them to Steam.

The community managed to get 500,000 accounts created and are currently seeing about 15,000 people playing Counter-Strike 1.6 at any given time. We know that the conversion process has been anything but smooth for many of our users. We''re going to get this fixed. We''ve done our best to support the Half-Life community over the past 5 years, and we''re still committed to doing whatever it takes to make the community happy. We''ve listened to the response, and we''ll be repairing the problems with Steam until it performs the way we all want it to.<br/><br/>Tomorrow we will release new installers which include the cache files for all of the games available via Steam (Day of Defeat, Team Fortress Classic, the dedicated server, etc). If you haven''t already done so, please use the installer that includes Counter-Strike and Half-Life.<br/><br/>Here''s what''s going on at Steam HQ:<br/><br/><ul style="padding-bottom: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><li> We ran into some pretty serious bandwidth and server limitations after the release last week, which has caused several other problems like long wait times and UI unresponsiveness. The load is starting to die down now and we''re getting more content servers lined up, so these problems are becoming less frequent. As more people begin using the new installers which include the game caches, their experience using Steam will improve greatly. If you''re having problems connecting to Steam or launching Counter-Strike, please download the latest version of the installer and give it a try. <br/><li> Some other Steam problems -- "JIT" error messages, expired ticket errors, etc -- will be fixed with a Steam update this week.<br/></li></li></ul><br/>Other stuff:<br/><br/><ul style="padding-bottom: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><li> Counter-Strike 1.5 is still available, and will be for a couple of weeks. After we''re confident that the Steam authentication servers are functioning as they should (and not before), we''ll be turning off the WON servers and migrating everyone over to the new system. <br/><li> There have been some reports of the Conversion Wizard failing during account creation. If this happens for you, please try downloading and installing the most recent version of the Steam client from one of the mirrors listed on this site. <br/><li> We''re preparing a new installer on CD for cyber-cafe owners. Contact biz@steampowered.com if you''re interested in receiving this. <br/><li> We''ve heard from several people who are having trouble getting their MODs working with Steam. We''ve updated our FAQ with new information about this. Check it out and then email us if you''re still having trouble.<br/></li></li></li></li></ul><br/>Feel free to get in touch with us you''re having difficulty, or for whatever reason.

Valve''s debut title was named "Best PC Game Ever" by <i>PC Gamer</i> and launched a franchise with more than eight million retails units sold worldwide.

The player again picks up the crowbar of research scientist, Gordon Freeman, who finds himself on an alien-infested Earth being picked to the bone, its resources depleted and its population dwindling.  Freeman is thrust into the unenviable role of rescuing the world from the wrong he unleashed back at Black Mesa.   And a lot of people - people he cares about - are counting on him.   The intense, real-time gameplay of <i>Half-Life 2</i> is made possible only by Source, Valve''s new proprietary engine technology.   Source provides major enhancements in the advanced facial animation system, physics, graphics and AI.  <i>Half-Life 2</i> will be available for the PC.<br/><br/><br/><u>About Vivendi Universal Games</u><br/>Headquartered in Los Angeles, VU Games is a leading global developer, publisher and distributor of multi-platform interactive entertainment.
