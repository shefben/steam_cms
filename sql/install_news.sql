This means that we will be resetting the Steam account database from scratch. After this, you will need to have a valid CD-Key to access games via Steam, so you will want to treat your Steam account as permanent. One CD-Key will grant you access to all of the games currently available in the Steam beta. The Friends database will remain intact, so if you create an account with the same name when the beta ends, you will retain your Friends list.<br/><br/>The next step will be to release the remaining three Half-Life 2 movies, fix the remaining issues with the Riot Shield in Counter-Strike, and any remaining issues with Steam. This will happen almost immediately after the Steam beta ends.<br/><br/>Some of the other features coming after the beta resets are:<br/><br/><ul style="padding-bottom: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><li> New version of Cobble reworked by David Johnston.<br/><li> Full Skin support in Steam.<br/><li> More detailed information regarding the cache file on your drive.<br/><li> Vastly more efficient use of disk space and bandwidth in Steam.<br/><li> New conversion wizard to make better use of existing content on your drive.</li></li></li></li></li></ul><br/>After this, we''ll release an update to the entire user base that will convert them to Steam.

We know that the conversion process has been anything but smooth for many of our users. We''re going to get this fixed. We''ve done our best to support the Half-Life community over the past 5 years, and we''re still committed to doing whatever it takes to make the community happy. We''ve listened to the response, and we''ll be repairing the problems with Steam until it performs the way we all want it to.<br/><br/>Tomorrow we will release new installers which include the cache files for all of the games available via Steam (Day of Defeat, Team Fortress Classic, the dedicated server, etc). If you haven''t already done so, please use the installer that includes Counter-Strike and Half-Life.<br/><br/>Here''s what''s going on at Steam HQ:<br/><br/><ul style="padding-bottom: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><li> We ran into some pretty serious bandwidth and server limitations after the release last week, which has caused several other problems like long wait times and UI unresponsiveness. The load is starting to die down now and we''re getting more content servers lined up, so these problems are becoming less frequent. As more people begin using the new installers which include the game caches, their experience using Steam will improve greatly. If you''re having problems connecting to Steam or launching Counter-Strike, please download the latest version of the installer and give it a try. <br/><li> Some other Steam problems -- "JIT" error messages, expired ticket errors, etc -- will be fixed with a Steam update this week.<br/></li></li></ul><br/>Other stuff:<br/><br/><ul style="padding-bottom: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><li> Counter-Strike 1.5 is still available, and will be for a couple of weeks. After we''re confident that the Steam authentication servers are functioning as they should (and not before), we''ll be turning off the WON servers and migrating everyone over to the new system. <br/><li> There have been some reports of the Conversion Wizard failing during account creation. If this happens for you, please try downloading and installing the most recent version of the Steam client from one of the mirrors listed on this site. <br/><li> We''re preparing a new installer on CD for cyber-cafe owners. Contact biz@steampowered.com if you''re interested in receiving this. <br/><li> We''ve heard from several people who are having trouble getting their MODs working with Steam. We''ve updated our FAQ with new information about this.

Blade.  The sworn enemies face off in Freeport City, a near-future mixture of San Francisco, Tokyo and New York, all set inside the unrestricted SiN universe.<br/><br/>The upcoming SiN Episodes chapter entitled Emergence is the first in a series of episodic adventures powered by the award-winning Source(tm) engine developed by Valve(r).  Delivered on Steam(tm), the online content delivery system, Sin Episodes takes a bold new step into the future of gaming.  <br/><br/>"Combining the incredible power of the Source engine with episodic content delivery via Steam has empowered us to raise the bar on key features of the SiN universe, interactivity, character driven gameplay, and emergent AI," said Tom Mustaine, cofounder and Director of Development for Ritual. <br/><br/>"Digitally delivered episodic content is the next frontier in the games industry," said Steve Nix, Ritual CEO, affording the award-winning development studio unprecedented flexibility. "Episodic development gives Ritual the opportunity to be much more responsive to community feedback and industry trends. We can adjust our content to deliver maximum entertainment value with each installment." <br/><br/>"One of our goals for Steam and Source is to provide a viable platform for independent developers who would rather be working on original IP," said Gabe Newell, founder and president of Valve. "It''s great to be working with Ritual again as they take this pioneering step for the industry. I look forward to purchasing my copy of SiN: Emergence."<br/><br/>SiN Episodes expands on the role of Colonel John R. Blade, a battle worn hero in charge of HardCorps, an elite strike force with a long history of conflict with SinTEK, a powerful multibillion dollar empire headed up by Elexis Sinclaire, a beautiful, brilliant, and ruthless scientist who is out to remake humanity according to her own twisted vision.  Joining Blade on his mission are JC, a HardCorps hacker with a secret to keep, and Jessica Cannon, a fiery rookie who can find her way into any secure facility.<br/><br/>SiN Episodes: Emergence features never before seen weapons, characters and environments along with a host of interactive options, paying homage to its predecessors, SiN and its expansion pack, Wages of SiN, which set a new bar for interactivity.  Additional information and purchasing options will be announced on www.sinepisodes.com or www.steampowered.com at a later date.<br/><br/>An 8-page preview of SiN Episodes: Emergence is featured in PCGamer UK''s August issue, which hits newsstands on July 7th, 2005.  The article includes exclusive images from the game along with additional materials available on the accompanying PCGamer UK DVD.<br/><br/>About Ritual<br/>Ritual Entertainment, a Dallas, Texas-based game development studio, has been a consistent leader in the evolution of content and technology for some of today''s most successful console and PC games.

In addition to the new missions and gameplay style, the Summer 2006 Update also introduces new technical features and gameplay enhancements to Day of Defeat: Source. Some of the new gameplay enhancements - such as spawn clip adjustments, improved hit location detection, and weapon balancing - were made after reviewing the player statistics gathered since the <a href="http://www.dayofdefeat.com/stats/">stats feature</a> was added to DoD: Source earlier this year.<br/><br/>Since its original release in the fall of last year, Valve has introduced a number of new features, missions, and enhancements for the game - following in the company''s long tradition of ongoing development for its online properties. Below is a summary of the new missions and features added to Day of Defeat: Source since the initial launch: <br/><br/><strong>New Missions Added:</strong><br/><br/>Colmar (June 2006) -- Set in Northern France, Colmar introduces Day of Defeat''s Detonation style of gameplay. Marred with cold weather conditions, Colmar''s Detonation objectives drive successful teams to attack target areas in unison.<br/><br/>Jagd (June 2006) - Jagd challenges teams to a more advanced urban Detonation mission, one that must be completed in a limited amount of time and is therefore unforgiving to unorganized offensive attacks.<br/><br/>Kalt (February 2006) - The narrow city streets, wheelhouse, and center bridge on which Kalt is fought challenge Axis and Allied forces to disperse and hold multiple points. As such, surging attacks and sudden changes in momentum may be common.<br/><br/>Argentan (January 2006) - The first new mission introduced after the initial launch of Day of Defeat: Source is set alongside the rolling hills of a French trainway. It''s hillsides and country structures provide the setting for punishing sniper and machine gunner standoffs.<br/><br/><strong>Technology Updates:</strong><ul style="padding-bottom: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" type="square"><li> Color Correction<br/><li> Film grain<br/><li> New Shaders:<ul style="padding-bottom: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" type="square"><li> Image-based texture blending<br/><li> Light warping<br/><li> Phong Shading/Rim Lighting on player models</li></li></li></ul><br/><li>Improved Animations<br/><li> Support for Bloom on DX8 level GPUs <br/><li> Prop Vertex Lighting <br/><li> Engine Optimizations</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul><br/><strong>Gameplay Enhancements:</strong><ul style="padding-bottom: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" type="square"><li> Spawn Clip adjustments<br/><li> Improved Hit location detection<br/><li> Weapon balancing<br/><li> Detonation Gameplay Introduced<br/><li> Player Statistics</li></li></li></li></li></ul><br/>Available via Steam and at retail outlets the world over, Day of Defeat: Source is one of today''s most played online action games. Players join the ranks of Axis vs. Allies battles in Western Europe at the height of the war in 1944.  Players enlist in specific combat roles, ranging from scouts to sharpshooters, and are tasked, as a unit, to complete objective-based missions.<br/><br/>For more information on Day of Defeat: Source, Valve or Valve''s games, please visit <a href="http://www.steamgames.com/">www.steamgames.com</a>.<br/><br/><strong>About Valve</strong><br/>Valve is an entertainment software and technology company founded in 1996 and based in Bellevue, Washington.
