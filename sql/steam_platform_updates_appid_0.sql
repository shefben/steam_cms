<p>A small number of Half-Life 2 customers have been experiencing problems while playing the game, and we have traced these issues to corrupt Steam cache files.

If you have been experiencing problems such as crashing during gameplay or startup of Half-Life 2, please <span style=\"color:#BFBA50;font-weight:bold;\">restart Steam</span> and then click on one of the links below. Steam will then automatically verify your cache files.

<p>An update has been released for the Steam Client and will be automatically downloaded.<br/><br/><b>NOTE:</b> An additional minor update for Windows users was released on March 1 with the following change:<br/><br/><ul style=\"padding-bottom: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;\"><li> Fixed crash on game launch for some older 2D games, including Plants vs. Zombies</li></ul><br/><b>General</b><br/><ul style=\"padding-bottom: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;\"><li> Restrict chat from users who do not share a friends, game server, or multiuser chat relationship with you<br/><li> Fixed a case where having Steam Cloud sync disabled (either globally or for an App) could cause that App to be told there were no local files found<br/><li> Reduced memory usage of games which integrate Steamworks cloud storage features <br/><li> Improved stability of games which make Steamworks API calls from multiple threads simultaneously<br/></li></li></li></li></ul><br/><b>Big Picture</b><br/><ul style=\"padding-bottom: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;\"><li> When Steam is first launched only show up to 4 notifications for friends that are in a game, otherwise just show a single summary notification <br/><li> Improved performance when displaying a large list of scrollable items<br/></li></li></ul><br/><b>Steam Controller</b><br/><ul style=\"padding-bottom: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;\"><li> Added per-account Controller Personalization. <br/><li> Added support for Configuration Travelling,  <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/controller/update/dec15\"> Click here for details </a><br/><li> Added Trigger Mouse Dampening options for soft pull/soft+full pull. Defaults to previous Soft Pull only mode. <br/><li> Added mouse region snapping support for non-mode-shifted mouse regions. Mouse regions can now snap or not-snap to previous position when they\'re not in use. <br/><li> Overlay Disabled message is now shown in Big Picture game screen when the overlay is disabled. <br/><li> Added New Export Save System. Unifies and simplifies exporting configurations. You can now more easily browse and save Private and Public configurations, including replacing/editing existing configurations. <br/><li>  Added Exporting new Configuration Templates for often used configuration defaults. <br/><li> Added Browsing/Importing of all games configurations from any game. Useful for when you made the perfect setup in a sequel or similar game and want to use the same config as a base or verbatim. <br/><li> Publishing a new community configuration now requires you to have played with the configuration for at least an hour.<br/><li> Added additional Touch Menu selection settings to allow selection on Release Click and on Release Touch.<br/><li> Added Trigger Hip Fire Exclusive mode - this mode is a dual stage trigger mode that allows either soft or full pull, but once either is engaged, the other will not engage until the trigger has been released.<br/><li> When exiting Steam, Controller now returns to its default “lizardmode” Mouse/Keyboard state <br/><li> If Steam loses its ability to send input due to UAC/Control-Alt-Del prompts, controller will now attempt to drop into its default state to allow interaction with these dialogs and resume normal configuration once workable state is re-established. The controller will beep when entering/exiting this mode. <br/><li> Fixed bug with joystick not always sending fast taps to the left. <br/><li> Anti-Deadzone now obeys deadzone shape setting. For gyro applications such as Steering Wheel in Racing games, using the cross shaped deadzone will provide expected anti-deadzone behavior. <br/><li> Added better support for non-Steam games and applications that cannot use the Steam Overlay such as browsers, command line tools, emulators, etc.. While these applications won’t currently support some functions such as touchmenus, xinput, and controller HUD functionality, these applications will now be better detected and use their Non-Steam Game configuration when in focus. <br/><li> Shortcuts/Non-Steam games will also attempt to use their designated configuration when launched outside of Steam, provided Steam is running in the background, with the same limitations mentioned above. <br/><li> Fixed legacy bindings on configurations with native controller support not displaying/working outside of the first action set.<br/><li> Fixed a dead zone issue when a trackpad was used in Mouse mode<br/></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul><br/><b>In-Home Streaming</b><br/><ul style=\"padding-bottom: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;\"><li> Added support for streaming 5.1 audio from Windows host machines to other Steam Clients and the Steam Link. <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/groups/homestream/discussions/0/451850468361733047\"> Click here for more info </a><br/><li> Fixed a issue causing framerate on the streaming client to be much lower than on the host for GPU-intensive games<br/><li> Added NVIDIA NVFBC encoder as a separate option under Advanced Host Settings in Big Picture mode<br/><li> Added logic to retry any previously-failed encoding methods whenever a new game is launched<br/><li> Added logic to fall back to software encoding when hardware encoding is being unreasonably slow<br/><li> Fixed one-pixel color misalignment in Direct3D 9 games such as Rocket League <br/><li> Significantly improved performance of Intel QuickSync encoding - please note that Intel has released new drivers for most of its GPUs, which are recommended for performance and stability ( http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/graphics-drivers.html )<br/><li> Improved compatibility with Dragon\'s Lair, Space Age, and other older 2D games<br/><li> Improved stream quality and bitrate usage for games running below 60 fps<br/><li> Improved compatibility with Stronghold Crusader HD and other old DirectDraw titles<br/><li> Adjusted settings for Intel hardware encoding to improve compatibility with 4th and 5th gen Intel CPUs<br/></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul><br/><b>VR Mode</b><br/><ul style=\"padding-bottom: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;\"><li> Steam notifications now display in-headset using the work-in-progress SteamVR notification system.<br/><li> Improved support for VR keyboard.

<p>(<b>Updated August 23</b>: The client has been re-released with additional fixes for minor issues caused by the previous update.)<br/><br/>A new Steam client has been released and is being automatically downloaded. Changes since the last major release include the following:<br/><br/><b>Mac OS X / macOS</b><br/><ul style=\"padding-bottom: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;\"><li>The Steam application has been reworked for better compatibility with macOS Sierra. This may result in an older copy of the Steam application being placed in your Trash. It is safe to delete the older copy by emptying the trash.</li></ul><br/><b>Linux</b><br/><ul style=\"padding-bottom: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;\"><li>Fixed handling of clickable URLs in chat text for the desktop Steam client</li></ul><br/><b>General</b><br/><ul style=\"padding-bottom: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;\"><li>Fixed a crash when games passed certain parameters to the Steamworks API<br/><li>Added button to clear local cache under download settings. This may fix downloads by removing stale or corrupt cached data. <br/><li>Added UI text to indicate if a selected title is excluded from Family Sharing <br/><li>Worked around a problem where a recent Windows 10 update could cause Xbox One controllers to send duplicate input<br/><li>Fixed cases where playing a free game could trigger Family Sharing error messages</li></li></li></li></li></ul><br/><b>In-Home Streaming</b><br/><ul style=\"padding-bottom: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;\"><li>Added support for spectating VR games from the Steam Link, mirroring the VR player\'s viewpoint</li></ul><br/><b>Steam Controller</b><br/><ul style=\"padding-bottom: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;\"><li>Added \"Set Cursor Position\" binding controller action. This allows an arbitrary X/Y position to be moved to on a button press and optionally warp back to the original position on release. When combined with a click via either multi-binding or an additional activator, allows for on-screen UI to be bound to buttons even if they have no hotkey. Multiple Set Cursor Position inputs can be multi-bound to a single button allowing cursor position binding cycling. <br/><li>Scroll wheel Mode on Joystick now ignores the joystick returning to the center position when doing horizontal/vertical scrolling. This allows for bindings to be cycled through scroll wheel on left/right or up/down taps. <br/><li>Added Gyro Button Behavior setting. Allows for the Gyro Enable Button to be flipped to be a Gyro Disable Button, so gyro is disabled while the specified button is held, but otherwise on all the time. <br/><li>Fixed broken configurations where modes could be attached to sources that don’t support them which caused errors in both the UI and in behavior. <br/><li>Fixed issues with Double Press activator not working in certain games. <br/><li>Fixed Interruptible activators not interrupting in a few specific scenarios.<br/><li>Fixed haptic location not always being updated properly with activators. <br/><li>Changed new full press activators to use the mode\'s current haptic setting as a default setting on the new activator. <br/><li>Fixed activator-based haptics on specfic switch buttons to be correct based on physical position on the controller. <br/><li>Fixed a bug when turning off legacy mode while editing Triggers. <br/><li>Fixed incorrect modes being created when a developer is creating a new native configuration. <br/><li>Fixed configurator option not showing up if game was VR capable and had VR controller support but also had non-VR and normal controller support. <br/><li>Fixed adding action sets to fully legacy configs in games that have native configs. Now legacy action set configs and native configs won\'t stomp each other. <br/><li>Fixed mode-shifted mouse regions flipping their initial Y position if \"teleport on start\" was set that was introduced with recent set cursor position additions. <br/><li>Cleaned up the Choose Binding panel to improve legibility. <br/><li>Added icons for Controller Actions such as Change Action Set, Take Screenshot, Move Cursor, and Show On Screen Keyboard. <br/><li>Fixed the backslash character \'\\' not showing up on keyboard layouts. <br/><li>Added RB/LB buttons to change current action set when editing a configuration. <br/><li>Fixed gamepad binding highlights being offset in certain overlay resolutions<br/><li>Fixed issues that prevented Streaming gyro from functioning properly. <br/></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul></p>

This is useful to mark changes in state such as different action sets or mode shifts, or on start/release press activators for changing while a button is pressed, for example. Light settings are reset to user preference when changing applications/configurations. <br/><li>Added software calibration for non-Steam controller based IMUs to counter for gyro drift. <br/><li>Modes and bindings which are unavailable to desktop and Big Picture modes will no longer be shown in the configurator.<br/><li>Steam now shows a dialog when trying to edit a config for a controller which has opted out of being configurable. <br/><li>Unified Radial Menu Button Press/Release behavior on digital inputs such as physical face buttons or d-pads. <br/><li>Dismiss quit menu when minimizing or turning off a controller. <br/><li>Controllers now support a default Rumble Preference to be On or Off. Games can override this setting or use the default preference for that controller. Setting is available under each controllers Preferences in Controller Settings in Big Picture. <br/><li>Individual games can opt out of using Steam Configuration support for the PS4 controller under each game’s Controller Settings. If a game has native PS4 support this allows it to continue to be recognized directly. <br/><li>Changed mode shift button activators to be uninterruptible by default. <br/><li>Changed Mouse mode Gyro Enable Button to default to Always On when placed on a PS4 Controller. <br/><li>Changed Joystick Mouse to default to Wide Response.<br/><li>Configuration Browser can now be toggled to show all available controller types rather than the default of the in-use controller type. <br/><li>Configurations can now be marked as “Unique” to a specific controller. This configuration will only be applied to that controller for that user\'s account. By default, all controllers of a specific type will share a configuration unless marked as Unique. <br/><li>Fixed a bug where rumble would send to the incorrect controller and could cause controllers to control the incorrect player.<br/><li>Fixed default settings not applying properly to mode shifted modes, which could cause certain parameters to be incorrect by default on mode-shifts. <br/><li>SteamOS users should  update to the latest version of SteamOS, as described <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamuniverse#announcements/detail/683814770823055580\">here</a>.<br/><li>Linux users should consider upgrading your udev rules to allow Steam access to /dev/hidraw* , as described <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/app/353370/discussions/0/490123197956024380/\">here</a>.<br/></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul></p>
