Is Steam Spyware?','<br/>Some users have seen non-Steam related information (like names of private files on their computer) show up inside their Steam cache files, raising privacy concerns. This is actually a result of the way Windows handles files. The cache file gets created on the client using the Windows CreateFile() command. This command will create the file but not initialize it. Due to the large size of the file, the Steam client does not initialize the empty data blocks in it as this can take an appreciable amount of time. On NTFS machines, files created with this method happen to have the property of appearing empty (initialized to zero) but for FAT32 machines, it shows up as whatever old data was sitting on drive in the sectors that just got allocated for the cache. This data is never uploaded or even read by the Steam client. Eventually, as Steam downloads more data, the old data is overwritten.');

Steam is embedded within a Steam-enabled application giving it a virtual file system from which it can obtain "resources" (not files) from a local cache, CD or from the Internet.<br/><br/>Communicating with the Steam backend servers, digital rights management allow access to subscription (pay or free) content while at the same time ensuring the user always has current content. Advanced content "preloaders" are used to load the caches during application execution as well as during normal PC (or console) operation.<br/><br/>Caching content locally eliminates the "typical" issues associated with streaming content, that is, the data only needs to be read once. As the cache fills, a Least Recently Used algorithm purges old content allowing new content to take it''s place. Additionally, "trickle" downloading allows content to be delivered unobtrusively such that the content "just appears" to the user when it''s ready. In the case of Half-Life or Counter-Strike, no more rushing to an ftp site just to fight with others for the opportunity to download the latest update, map or mod. It will "just be there" when Valve says it will.<br/><br/>Steam, in the end, provides game and application developers a much simpler method for delivering content to their users, whether it''s for a controlled beta or all out publishing.');

Steam will then ask if you want to use offline mode. It''s that simple. Note that in order to be able to use any game in offline mode, that game''s content must be fully downloaded first. You can check to see how much of a game''s content has been downloaded by looking at its properties page (just right-click on the game''s name in your "My Games" list).<br/><br/>Offline mode is useful for gaming centers, cyber-cafes, and large scale LAN parties, where Internet connectivity is not practical.');

You can launch Steam using a "login" command line option. This is useful for many café system administrators. The syntax is as follows:<br/><br/><b>steam.exe -login [username] [password]</b><br/><br/>(Remember that Steam "usernames" are most often in the form of an email address.)<br/>(Note also that it will take a few seconds for the program to launch using this method, and that you may not see anything happening during this time.)');

Where can I find it?','<br/>The external IP address is the IP address your ISP assigns you for internet use. This is the address that the world sees when you go out onto the internet. I need to know what this address is so that I can unlock your CAS on our master server here. If I don''t unlock it for you then your CAS will not run and will complain that it can''t find the "heartbeat server".<br/><br/>What is termed the "internal address" is the address of the machines on your network, NOT the address that the outside world sees. Typically people use a router or some other piece of hardware between their PC''s and their cable/dsl modems and they run a network for those PC''s. The addresses of the PC''s on this "internal" network are usually something like 192.168.0.xxx. These are the internal addresses.<br/><br/>You can usually get your external IP address by calling your ISP or by checking with your router (it will have the address used for the internet in a setting somewhere inside it).   Or you can search on <a href="http://www.findmyip.com">www.findmyip.com</a>.');

So, you can have as many players as needed. If you sign up for our program, we will send you installation instructions on how to set up Steam. You can check the box that says ''remember your password'' and ''start Steam when Windows launches'' - that way an automatic login will pop up everytime you turn off your computers and everytime you close Steam.
