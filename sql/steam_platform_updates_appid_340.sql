<p>Valve is pleased to announce the official \'uncrating\' of <a href=\"http://www.steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=package&amp;SubId=469\">The Orange Box</a>, now available on Steam. <br/><br/>The Orange Box features three top-rated new games by Valve: Half-Life® 2: Episode Two, the second installment in the Half-Life 2 episodic trilogy; Team Fortress® 2, the sequel to the game that put class-based, multiplayer team warfare on the map; and Portal, the game that blends puzzles, first person action, and adventure gaming to produce an experience like no other. <br/><br/>To bring gamers up to date with the Half-Life 2 universe, The Orange Box also includes Half-Life 2, the best-selling and highest-rated action game series of all time, and the episodic debut Half-Life® 2: Episode One—together, more than 30 hours of award-winning gameplay. Purchasers of the PC version of The Orange Box who already own Half-Life 2 and Half-Life 2: Episode One can conveniently “gift” them to a friend from within Steam. <br/><br/>All games included in <a href=\"http://www.steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=package&amp;SubId=469\">The Orange Box</a> are available separately or as part of two exclusive Steam collections: <a href=\"http://storefront.steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=package&amp;SubId=479\">The Source Premier Pack</a> and <a href=\"http://storefront.steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=package&amp;SubId=478\">The Valve Complete Pack</a>.</p>
