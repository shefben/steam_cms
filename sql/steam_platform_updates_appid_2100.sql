Changes/Additions
	<ul>
<li> Added new game mode - Colosseum. Colosseum mode is designed for multiple players to duel amongst themselves in a series of individual fights

Each fight is between two teams - \'Humans\' and \'Undead\'
                  Players do not choose which team they are on - this is decided automatically.
                  Teams can have more than one player on the side - this is determined by the server when the game is started.
                  Non-fighting players can watch the fight in progress, and can bet XP on the outcome.
                  Winners of fights gain XP awards which can be used to purchase skills in the normal fashion.
                  Players share XP across all classes (so you can level up to 4 as a Knight, then switch to a level 4 mage if you want)
                  The \'contest\' is over at the end of the time limit (when the highest ranking XP player will \'win\') OR when the server-specified XP limit is reached by a player

                  Issues / things to be aware of in Colosseum
                  The style of the Colosseum game being played depends quite a lot on the server owner\'s configuration. We have implemented it with as much flexibility as possible, so server owners can do things like specify available classes, team sizes, betting amounts, fight times etc.

                  One class - the Priestess - has a rather strong effect on the outcome of Colosseum, as they are able to heal and resurrect others. Server owners may want to disable this class, or consider removing the resurrect abilities.

                  To remove resurrect abilities from a game, add these lines to the server.cfg file -
