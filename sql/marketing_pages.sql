	<h1>Available Now: 64-Bit Half-Life&reg; 2 and Lost Coast&trade;</h1><Br>



<a target="_new" href="http://amd64downloads.filecloud.com/hl2.asp"><img style="margin-right:16px;" align="left" src="64bit/img/athlon_64_FX.gif"></a>For those of you running with a 64-bit capable AMD&reg; processor, along with the Windows&reg; 64-bit operating system, Half-Life 2 and Lost Coast are now available in native 64-bit versions. Steam will automatically detect your OS and run the appropriate version the next time you run these games.<br>

<br>

We''ve been working with AMD to get the Source&trade; engine up and running in 64-bit mode to make sure we''re taking advantage of these hardware configurations. This is just a first step for Valve into 64-bit. Going forward, we realize that more and more of our customers will be running with 64-bit processors and we will be set to take true advantage of them.<br>

<br>

The official press release is available <a target="_new" href="http://steampowered.com/index.php?area=news&id=496">here</a>. <br>

	<h1>Friday, April 1 2005</h1>

	<br>

	An update is available for <b>Counter-Strike: Source</b>. The update will be applied automatically when your Steam client is restarted.

	This update addresses requests for more realism in Counter-Strike: Source.  The changes are as follows:<br>

	<br>

	<h2>Features/Additions</h2>

	<ul>

	<li>Doubled player speed when jumping. The effect to cumulative, so the more you jump, the faster you go.

	<li>Cut price of AWP by 50%.</li>

	<li>Added akimbo Riot Shield to buy menu.</li>

	<li>Removed de_dust from mapcycle.</li>

	</ul>

	<h2>Realism Enhancements:</h2>

	<br>

	<b>Knives:</b><br>

	Between rounds, it is suggested that you unsheath the weapon and repeatedly press the attack key to

	air it out as the leather now collects moisture and creates pits on the blade, making it less effective

	in the next round.<br>

	<br>

	<b>Shotguns:</b><br>

	1. Firing the shotgun without ammo loaded will now cause it to jam.<br>

	2. When the shotgun jams, press F2 to fill out form DA-1823-00/A12-H8.<br>

	3. You should then hear a scribbling sound.  When it stops, press F3 to send the request to LIDM.<br>

	4. Failure to do paperwork before pressing F3 will result in the immediate return of the unrepaired shotgun.<br>

	5. The repairs can take 1-2 rounds for completion.  During that time, you cannot purchase a replacement firearm and may only use your sidearm or knife.<br>

	<br>

	<b>Player Models:</b><br>

	Several models now feature eyewear.  This is a completely cosmetic enhancement with the following exceptions:<br>

	<ul>

	<li>Part EP-7829-292-2 must be purchased and worn correctly at all times in order to see during the round.<br>

	<li>In between rounds, you may purchase and use part EC-2231-833-H34 to clean your EP-7829-292-2.  Note: that this does not clean the eyewear itself!<br>

	<li>To clean the eyewear, you need to purchase and use the designated cleaner, EC-2231-233-H34, EC-2231-523-H34, or EC-2231-239-H34a respectively depending on your model''s eyewear. You can determine the part # of the correct cleaner by asking someone.<br>

	</ul>



	<b>Machine and submachine guns:</b><br>

	<ul>

	<li>At least once every five rounds, press F1 to inspect the weapon:</li>

	<li>A musical cue indicates that the inspection has started. Now press F1 again repeatedly to clean and lubricate the weapon.<br>

	<li>Your Preventative Maintenance Status (either "cleaning" or "lubricating") is determined by the speed with which you press the F1 key and will be displayed above your head.<br>

	<li>To accurately simulate real life maintenance mistakes, pressing F1 too quickly will lubricate either the bolt face or the trunnion block.  Pressing F1 too slowly sprays lubricant directly into the buffer tube.  All mistakes render the gun inoperable, though this may not become immediately apparent.<br>

	<li>Experiment with keypress timing to avoid (and discover!) other common maintenance errors.<br>

	<li>In order to balance the improved stopping power of a well-maintained weapon, the reloading process has been made much less reliable.<br>

	<li>When reloading, you should listen for two or three distinct clicks over a period of several seconds.<br>

	<li>If you hear one click or no clicks or more than two clicks, you''ve bent the link ejector chute and the gun will most likely explode on the next attempt to fire it, though it may not.<br>

	</ul>

As always, pre-loading the game is free, with no obligation. When you pre-load a game on Steam, you receive the full game on your computer in a locked form. Then, if you choose to purchase later, you''ll be ready to unlock and play immediately when the game is officially released. Haven''t checked out the game, yet?

	<img align="left" src="April7.2006/img/Alyx.gif" style="margin-right:4px;margin-top:4px;">In other episodic news, today we''ve launched <a href="steam://openurl/http://ep1.half-life2.com">the official web site of Half-Life 2: Episode One</a>. There you can find screenshots, a trailer, information about the story, and more.<br>

	<br clear="all">

	<hr>

	<br>

	And finally, we''ve put together a Day of Defeat: Source "<a href="steam://openurl/http://dayofdefeat.com/stats/">War Status Report</a>" web site showing lots of detailed gameplay statistics. For example, the Axis K98 rifle is most accurate when used at a distance of approximately 58 feet from the target. Might want to choose that weapon next time you find yourself on the Axis side playing Donner (because according to the stats page, the odds are you''re going to lose). <br>

		On Tuesday we began running an updated version of our hardware survey. So far, we''ve had over 600,000 unique responses. You can see the current results <a href="http://www.steampowered.com/status/survey.html">here</a>.<br>

		<br>

		Running surveys like this are extremely useful for us as developers, as it helps us to understand what kinds of technology decisions we can make as we continue to invest in the Source engine. It should also be useful for MOD developers to get an idea of what their audience looks like.<br>

		<br>

		<hr>

		<br>

		Next week we''ll be releasing the three HL2DM map contest winners on Steam. The winners of the contest along with some images of the maps were first mentioned <a href="http://steampowered.com/Steam/Marketing/Mar18.2005/">here</a>. Also next week, we''ll have a small sneak peak for you of the upcoming Half-Life 2 episode "Aftermath".<br>

The team that built the game, Tripwire, has released its first update and more will follow. They put together <a href="http://storefront.steampowered.com/video/RedOrchestra_Trailer2.wmv">an all new gameplay movie</a>, and they''ve also been getting some nice press that you can find on <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/pc/redorchestraostfront4145?q=red%20orchestra">their Metacritic page</a>.<br>

The past couple of days have been spent with the team adding commentary tracks. Hopefully it will be interesting for people to gain some insight into our development processes. It''s pretty hectic around the office, but it is always a lot of fun to be so close to shipping. <br>

		We hope everyone is enjoying the Half-Life 2: Deathmatch contest winning maps that were released earlier this week.<br>

		<br>

		The next big Counter-Strike release is set to include two maps. The first map will be de_port, previously mentioned <a href="http://www.steampowered.com/Steam/Marketing/Mar10.2005/">here</a>. This map is set in a resupply port for outgoing ships. The gameplay is designed for a balanced layout employing a mix of long sightlines with cover and close quarters fighting environments. The second map will be a completely redone de_inferno, a historical favorite at CS tournaments and competions. We''ll be releasing some screenshots or other media from both of these maps in the next week or two.<br>

		<br>

		<hr>

		<br>

		We also promised a sneak peek into work on Half-Life 2: Aftermath. Here is a shot from that, the continuation of Gordon Freemanï¿½s adventures that we''ll be releasing as an episode later this summer.<br>

	Preloading of Ritual''s Sin Episode 1: Emergence continues, with thousands of gamers waiting patiently for May 10th to come around so they can start playing.

	Here at Valve, we''ve finalized the commentary tracks we''ll be releasing along with <a href="steam://openurl/http://ep1.half-life2.com">Half-Life 2: Episode One</a>. When you start up a new game you''ll have the option to play with commentary enabled, which means there will be usable nodes in the world for you to learn about what went into building the game. Looks like we''ll end up with over 100 total nodes and about one hour of total spoken commentary. The community response to the commentary system in Lost Coast drove a lot of our thinking while creating it, so we hope everyone enjoys it when they are playing Episode One.<br>

	<br><hr><br>

	Most people have also probably noticed that the Friends system is currently quite functional in Steam, but still in beta. You can <a href="steam://open/friends">try out the beta now</a>; your list of friends will still be there after the beta period has ended.<br>

		This week we''d like to give everyone some information on our new Counter-Strike: Source map that

		we''ve been working on, as well as a new Half-Life 2: Deathmatch map we''ll be releasing next

		week.<br>

		<br>

		It is a bit daunting to learn a new Counter-Strike map right as it''s released, so we''ve gone

		through de_port and tried to give people an idea of what our design intentions were. Click

		<a href="http://steampowered.com/games/css/strategy/">here</a> to get to a page that outlines six

		different strategies to try once the map is available. We''re still shooting for release of

		de_port (along with a redone de_inferno) in a couple of weeks. Next week''s Steam news will

		include some pictures showing off what de_inferno looked like as it was being built from

		scratch.<br>

		<br>

		We''ll be releasing a new Half-Life 2: Deathmatch map this coming Monday the 25th. This new

		Valve created map is called dm_runoff and was inspired by a Half-Life 1 favorite,

		<i>Crossfire</i>.<br>

		This week we''re going to be talking about some Source-based projects from folks other than Valve.<br>
		<br>
		The team over at <a href="http://www.planofattackgame.com/">Plan of Attack</a> released the first 
		version of their game, which focuses on strategic team game play, where the players on each team 
		are presented decisions at the start of each round that impact the flow of the game. Here at Valve 
		we got a chance to play the game before it was released and had a lot of fun playing with their 
		development team. Congratulations to their entire team for getting it out the door, and we''re 
		looking forward to watching it evolve over time. Head on over to their 
		<a href="http://www.planofattackgame.com/">website</a> to download and play the latest version.<br>
		<br>
		Another interesting Source-based game has been announced today. The Alien Swarm team launched a 
		new <a href="http://www.blackcatgames.com/swarm/">site</a> showing off the Source version of 
		their game, and IGN has the first <a href="http://pc.ign.com/articles/608/608624p1.html">preview</a>
		up on their page. We''re all looking forward to seeing what their team can do with their game using
		Source.<br>
		<br>
		Lastly, we promised some new media on the Counter-Strike: Source version of de_inferno this week, 
		but we didn''t quite have enough time to get everything together. We''re now shooting for getting that 
		done next week.<br>

	<h1>Friday, August 5 2005</h1>

	<br>

	While we know we''re starting to sound a little like a broken record, Lost Coast, Day of Defeat, and Aftermath are in the final phases of development and being polished for release. While the latter two aren''t quite at the point where we can nail down an exact release date, we''re expecting to have Lost Coast ready in a couple of weeks.<br>

	<br>

	One of the interesting features we added to Lost Coast is a commentary system, where you''ll be able to hear first-hand some of the background on the features and choices in Lost Coast from the team responsible for building it. If this is something that goes over well with the community, we''ll be adding it into our future titles.<br>

	<br>

	We''ll also be releasing a new SAS model for Counter-Strike: Source in the very near future. Here are a couple of screenshots of what it looks like currently.<br>

	<br>

	<br>

	Finally, next week we''ll have an announcement of another new game that will be coming to Steam that wasn''t built here at Valve.<br>

	<h1>Friday, August 12 2005</h1>

	<br>

	Last week we <a href="http://www.steampowered.com/Steam/Marketing/August5.2005/">mentioned</a> that we''d be announcing a new product coming to Steam soon.<br>

	<br>

	We''re excited to announce that <!-- <a href="http://personal.lionhead.com/mhealey/"> --> <i>Rag Doll Kung Fu</i><!-- </a> -->, developed primarily by Mark Healy, will be making its way to Steam in the coming weeks. Mark is a game industry veteran who developed Rag Doll Kung Fu in his spare time. He initially showed the game off in the Experimental Game area of the Game Developers Conference earlier this year, where it stood out among a crowd of great looking games.<br>

	<br>

    In Rag Doll Kung Fu you act as a puppeteer in a martial arts world, but that doesn''t really describe what this game is about. With most games we would use this space to describe what its like to play, but in this case we don''t think it''s possible -- you''ll just have to watch the <a href="http://storefront.steampowered.com/video/RagDoll_KungFu.wmv">gameplay trailer</a> to understand. In short, it''s all about Chi power.<br>

	<br>

	<a href="August12.2005/img/RDKF.jpg"><img width="180" height="135" src="August12.2005/img/RDKF_small.jpg"></a> &nbsp; <br>

	<br>

	In the coming weeks we''ll have more info, including pricing and a release date.

	<h1>Friday, August 19 2005</h1>

	<br>

	In the next month or so there will be a number of Valve products being made available on Steam, but this week we''d like to spotlight a game that is being built using the Source engine.<br>

	<br>

	<a href="http://www.mightandmagic.com/us/darkmessiah/teaser/">Dark Messiah of Might and Magic</a> has been announced, and is being developed by Arkane Studios. Everyone around Valve played most of the previous Might and Magic games, and we''re all big fans of Arkane''s previous work. Like a lot of gamers, we''re looking forward to playing the finished product.<br>

	<br>

	<br>

	We''ll also be releasing Half-Life: Blue Shift on Steam next week, which will be automatically playable by anyone who owns Half-Life 1, including those who purchased the <a href="steam://store" target=_self >Half-Life 2 Silver or Gold packages</a>.<br>

	<h1>Friday, August 26 2005</h1>

	<br>

	Bringing owners of the original Half-Life a blast-from-the-past&trade;, earlier this week we released "Half-Life: Blue Shift" on Steam. This game was made by Gearbox Software and originally released in 2001 as an add-on to Half-Life. In it, you play as Barney Calhoun, the security guard sidekick who helped Gordon out of so many sticky situations back in the Black Mesa Research Facility.<br>

	<br>

	<a href="August26.2005/img/BlueShift.jpg"><img width="180" height="135" src="August26.2005/img/BlueShift_small.jpg"></a>

	<img width="180" height="135" src="August26.2005/img/Barney_small.jpg"><br>

	<br>

	Fans will remember that Blue Shift included a "High Definition Pack," a set of visually enhanced player and weapon models. We''ve had to iron out some technical wrinkles with how we deliver the HD Pack, but it will be made available through Steam within the next week or so.<br>

	<hr>

	We''d also like to take this opportunity to share <a href="August26.2005/img/DOD-S_Axis.jpg">an angry Axis soldier</a> running across the Day of Defeat: Source map "Flash." He and his shovel are coming soon to a Steam Games List near you. (It''s difficult for us to pin the exact date down right now, but rest assured it''s not far off.)

	<h1>Friday, December 2 2005</h1><Br>

	We''ve been having fun the past few days playing on Internet <a href="steam://store/300">Day of Defeat: Source</a> servers on the new map "Argentan," and on <a href="steam://store/240">Counter-Strike: Source</a>''s updated version of de_nuke. So far both maps have been really well received - we''re glad everyone is enjoying them as much as we are. Next up on the Counter-Strike: Source front will be the release of two new player models.<br>

	<br>	

	This week on Steam, <a href="steam://store/1500">Darwinia</a> became available for pre-purchase at a discount of 10% off the full price, $19.95 USD. (This discount will remain in effect until the game is released on December 14th.) We''re really excited to ship this title. Hint: don''t make too many plans for December 15th, because you''ll be tired from staying up all night. Here''s <a href="http://storefront.steampowered.com/video/darwinia-steam.wmv">a video preview of Darwinia in action</a> (52MB).<br>

	<br>	

	The folks over at Ritual also have been keeping the community up to date with the development of the Sin Episodes. There are a couple of in-game screenshots below, and more over at <a target="_new" href="http://www.sinepisodes.com/">their site</a>. <br>

		Hi, this is Gabe Newell. Normally the weekly Steam update news is written collaboratively by a number of people around Valve, but this week I''m grabbing the reins and writing it myself.<br>
		<br>
	<a target="_new" href="December9.2005/img/Darwinia_Temple.jpg"><img style="margin-right:12px;" align="left" width="200" height="150" src="December9.2005/img/Darwinia_Temple_thumb.jpg"></a> I''ve been playing a lot of Darwinia lately. Like most of you reading this, I play a lot of games and most of them don''t manage to capture my attention for very long. But I''m now playing through Darwinia a second time, so I think it''s fair to say I''m hooked. I''m currently on <i>Temple</i>, and while I''m not as good at the game as some people around the office, I''ve managed to get Airstrike researched to level 4.0 which is pretty satisfying. It''ll be out on Steam this coming Wednesday, and the demo will be available shortly before its launch. Send an e-mail to me at gaben@valvesoftware.com and tell me what you think of the game once you''ve played it.<br>
	</div>
	<hr>
	We recently had several members of the hardware press out to to Valve to see the new Day of Defeat movie we used to drive some new features in the Source engine. A number of articles about their visit should surface over the next week or so. The first one we''ve seen is over at <a target="_new" href="http://www.bit-tech.net/gaming/2005/12/09/source_film_effects/">Bit-Tech.net</a>.<br>

We have one more week of releases coming to Steam before we close out 2005. Next week there will be two new player models, one for each team, released for Counter-Strike: Source. Early next year we''ll be releasing a completely rebuilt version of cs_militia. There is also a fairly high chance we''ll be releasing an update to Day of Defeat: Source next week, which will include a number of small changes.<br>

<br>
Earlier this week Darwinia was launched, and from what we''ve gathered, people are really enjoying the game. If you''re not sure if Darwinia is for you, check out the demo <a href="steam://store/1500">here</a>.<br>
<br>
We''d also like to congratulate the folks over at <a target="_new" href="http://www.darwinia.co.uk/">Introversion Software</a> for Darwinia''s <a target="_new" href="http://www.igf.com/2006entrants.shtml">4 nominations</a> at next year''s Independent Games Festival. As we''ve mentioned a number of times, we''re all huge fans of the game, and it''s great to see the game get the recognition it deserves.<br>

	<h1>Friday, December 23 2005</h1><Br>



This was a busy week for us as far as releases were concerned, with updates to Counter-Strike: Source, the Source engine running in 64 bit, and Day of Defeat: Source. We hope everyone is enjoying the new content. The plan is to keep releasing updates and new games next year.<br>

<br>

There are literally millions of people in the community that connect to Steam each month, so we compiled a couple of statistics for what has happened in the past year:<br>

	<ul>

		<li>Steam has delivered approximately 10 million gigabytes of data since the first of the year. You could fill 125,000 80 GB hard drives with this data to make a line over 11 miles long. Not that you would want to, but the visual helps.</li> 

	    <li>There have been a total of 50 billion player minutes in our multiplayer games since the start of the year. If a single person sat down to play on their own, it would take 2.28 million years to accomplish this. This is assuming that you''re not planning on sleeping during this 2 million year stretch.</li>

	</ul>

		<br>
Over the next month or so there will be a couple of interesting releases via Steam, in addition to the upcoming Counter-Strike map cs_compound.<br>
<br>
First, we''ll be releasing an update to Half-Life 2: Deathmatch that will include the Slam, Stunstick, and the Crowbar. We''re not ready to release the contest winning maps just yet, but we will be releasing a new map we''ve built at Valve to tide people over while we sort out the contest winners. There will also be a release to Counter-Strike: Source around the same time that will address a few minor issues.<br>
<br>
One feature that we''ll be adding to the Source engine in the coming months is high dynamic range lighting. To showcase this we''ve taken a part of the Highway 17 chapter of Half-Life 2 and worked it into a single level that incorporates HDR along with some new gameplay. We''re calling this short level "The Lost Coast," and it will be made available free of charge to Half-Life 2 customers that meet a specific set of high end hardware requirements. We''ll be publishing those requirements soon.<br>
<br>
Below are a few early concept sketches of the level early in its development.<br>

		Friday, February 11 2005</h1>

		<br>

		In advance of the Counter-Strike: Source update we''ve mentioned here recently, we''ll be releasing an update for Half-Life 2: Deathmatch. This update will include two new weapons (the StunStick and the Slam) as well as a return of the trusty crowbar. We''ve decided to also include a new map called "Steam Lab."<br>

		<br>

		Here are a few images:<br>

		<a target="_new" href="Feb11.2005/img/steamlab_4.jpg"><img src="Feb11.2005/img/steamlab_4_small.jpg"></a>

		<br><br>

		Right around the same time, we''ll be releasing the source code to Half-Life 2: Deathmatch in the SDK.<br>

		<br>

		This release will happen some time next week. Right now, we''re shooting for Thursday the 17th.<br>

		<br>

		And just a quick note for those of you who have been asking -- <em>yes, VAC 2 is coming</em>.<br>

		At approximately 4:00 pm PST we''ll be releasing an update that primarily focuses on Half-Life 2: Deathmatch. This update will include the addition of the Stunstick, SLAM, and the Crowbar. It will also include a new original map made by Valve, called Steamlab.<br>
		<br>
		Along with the update to the game, we''ll be releasing the source code for Half-Life 2: Deathmatch in an update to the Source SDK, which should give our MOD community a wide range of functionality they can use to build their games. We''re all excited to see what is built based off of it. The update to the SDK will also allow MOD developers to write their own custom shaders, which will lead to some unique visuals in their games.<br>
		<br>
		Looking ahead to next week, we''re still on track for the Counter-Strike update, which will include a new map called cs_compound, along with a number of smaller changes and bug fixes.<br>

		While we''ve been talking for a number of weeks about the new hostage rescue map we''ve been working on (cs_compound), Turtle Rock Studios has also been working on getting de_train converted over to Counter-Strike: Source. Along with cs_compound, we''ll be including the new version of de_train in tomorrow''s release.<br>
		<br>
		Along with the two new maps, there are a number of fixes to the bots in Counter-Strike, an enhancement to the radar to display your current location in the map, and a fix for Half-Life 2: Deathmatch where players are disguising themselves as headcrabs, filing cabinets, and other invalid models.<br>
		<br>
		Here''s a preview of de_train:<br>

	<h1>Friday, February 24 2006</h1><br>

	As we''ve <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.steampowered.com/Steam/Marketing/April15.2005/">mentioned before</a>, we''ve been hard at work on the continuation of Half-Life 2 for some time now. Soon, as part of the upcoming Half-Life 2: Episode One, you''ll find out about what happened to the Citadel after the end of HL2, what happened to your nemesis Breen, and how Alyx managed to survive the explosion at the game''s end. You''ll also learn a lot more about Alyx, since nearly the entire episode is spent with her at your side.   <br>

	<br>

	<a href="steam://openurl/http://steampowered.com/Steam/Marketing/February24.2006/img/HL2_EP1_Alyx_Silhouette1.jpg"><img src="February24.2006/img/HL2_EP1_Alyx_Silhouette1_s.jpg"></a><br>

	<br>

	During the development of Half-Life 2, we at Valve were frustrated at how long it took us (six years!) to ship the game. With that in mind , the decision was made to try an episodic approach to the next Half-Life products, each  designed to reveal new story, gameplay, and the latest Source technology in four to six hour experiences.<br>

	<br>

	Over the coming weeks, we''ll keep you informed about the game''s status. For now, head over to Computer and Video Games site to read <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/r/?page=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/interviews/interviews_story.php?id=134751">an interview with Valve''s Robin Walker</a> about Episode One.<br>

		<br>
		Going into February, there will be a release of a new Counter-Strike: Source map by Valve level designer Dave Riller. It''s a smaller hostage rescue map with the focus on close quarters fighting. This map is still being play tested, and we''re looking forward to seeing what the community thinks of it.<br>
		</div>
		<br>
		There are a number of other things we''re working on at Valve right now that we aren''t quite ready to talk about, but our resolution for the new year is to keep the community more informed about what''s ahead. To that end, there will be a weekly Steam message (like this one) to give people an idea of what we''re working on.<br>

		Wednesday, January 19th 2005</h1>

		<br>

		Last week marked the end of the Half-Life 2: Deathmatch level design contest. We received over 200 submissions, and we''re going through and playtesting each one. There are a number of great maps in here, and we''re already having trouble picking the clear winners. The release of the winning maps will coincide with a release of Half-Life 2: Deathmatch, which will include two new weapons: the Slam and Stunstick.<br>

		<br>

		<img width="180" height="131" src="Jan19.2005/img/stunstick.jpg" alt="Stunstick!"><br>

		<br>

		Also of note for level designers and Mod builders: there will be an update to the Half-Life SDK this week which most notably will include source files for six Half-Life 2 maps.<br>

		<br>

		Lastly, work on Dave Riller''s new map cs_compound continues, along with the other projects we''re working on here at Valve. We''ll have an update on the map and our other projects next month.<br>

	This month we''re planning map releases for both <a title="Click here to get Day of Defeat: Source" href="steam://store/300">Day of Defeat: Source</a> and <a title="Click here to get Counter-Strike: Source" href="steam://store/240">Counter-Strike: Source</a>. For Day of Defeat, we''ll be releasing a completely rebuilt version of the classic map <i>Kalt</i>. Known as a balanced level set in winter (in German, Kalt means "cold"), Kalt is also a good choice for players who are new to Day of Defeat. For this release, there has even been some custom rendering work done in the Source engine specifically to make the snow and ice look realistic.<br>

	<br>

	<a target="_new" href="January6.2006/img/DoD_Kalt_Bridge.jpg"><img src="January6.2006/img/DoD_Kalt_Bridge_thumb.jpg"></a><br>

	<br>

	For Counter-Strike: Source, we''ll soon be releasing <i>Militia</i>. This version will be a fairly major reworking of the original level, and, like the recently released <i>Nuke</i>, it will include HDR.<br>

	<br>

	There is also now a <a title="Install the RDKF demo!" href="steam://install/1003">demo</a> available for Rag Doll Kung Fu that you can check out to see if it''s the right game for you.<br>

	It appears that the response to this week''s release of the Counter-Strike: Source map <i>Militia</i> has been overwhelmingly positive, and we hope the community is having fun playing it. We''re also planning on including two new player models, one from each side, to choose from on each side in the next major Counter-Strike: Source release.<br>

  <br>  

  Next week we''ll be releasing the new map for <a href="steam://store/300">Day of Defeat: Source</a>, named <i>Kalt</i>, which we <a href="steam://openurl/http://steampowered.com/Steam/Marketing/January6.2006/">mentioned</a> a couple of weeks ago. Playtesting internally has wrapped up on the map (although we''re still playing daily), and we''re expecting this sixth map to be one of the more popular releases we''ve done so far. Also, there will be a Day of Defeat: Source retail box available at software retailers around the start of February. As with all of our games, expect more updates and more content to keep coming.<br>

	Play-testing <i>Day of Defeat: Source</i> has taken over the Valve offices. We''re expecting DoD fans and new players alike to have a blast with the game when it''s released later this summer. Polishing work is being done right now on the player animations, as well as lighting work on the various maps. Current favorite features include the new grenade stun effect, and the ability to deploy the machine gun on any surface.<br>

	A number of months ago the development team behind <a href="http://www.hl2ctf.com">Half-Life 2: Capture the Flag</a> challenged us to a <a href="http://www.steampowered.com/Steam/Marketing/Mar2.2005/">match</a>. The outcome of that match is still disputed, but it was a lot of fun, and hopefully fun for the community to watch. WeÂd love to play against the development teams of any multiplayer MODs out there.<br>
	<br>
	The gauntlet has been thrown down once again by the CTF team, and we''re more than happy to meet the challenge. This time around, however, we''ll be using <a href="http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_TV">SourceTV</a> so the entire community can watch the match as it happens. This should eliminate any question as to the true victor.<br>
	<br>
	We''re tentatively scheduled to do this in the next couple of weeks. Once we get closer to the main event we''ll be letting everyone know how to connect to a SourceTV server and watch the match as it happens, along with the date and time. The CTF team has recently released version 1.5 of their game, so if you''d like to be more familiar with it before spectating, you can <a href="http://www.hl2ctf.com/downloads.php">download it here</a>.<br>

	We''re happy that the recently released Counter-Strike: Source maps <i>de_inferno</i> and <i>de_port</i> have been so well received, and along those lines it''s time to start talking about what''s coming next. This week, we have a couple of screenshots from the remake of the classic Counter-Strike map <i>cs_assault</i>, which is now set in downtown Chicago.<br>

	<br>



	We always like to keep everyone abreast of the games the MOD community is working on, so here is a list of a few we''re keeping our eye on:<br>

	<br>

	<a href="http://www.planofattackgame.com/">Plan of Attack</a>, <!-- looks like the hostile planet web site is down :( <a href="http://www.hostile-planet.org">Hostile Planet</a>, --> <a href="http://www.pvkii.com/">Pirates, Vikings, and Knights 2</a>, <a href="http://www.svencoop.com/">Sven Co-Op 2</a>, <a href="http://www.sourceball.com/">Sourceball</a>, and <a href="http://dystopia-mod.com/">Dystopia</a><br>

	<br>

	All of these projects are at varying stages of development, ranging from the concept phase to having a playable game ready for you to download from their site. It''s cool to follow a MOD team from their initial concept through the eventual release, as you generally get to see a side of game development that is somewhat hidden with traditional game development companies.<br>

	<br>

	We''ve been pretty quiet about Day of Defeat: Source in the last few weeks. But new information and images from DoD: Source will be made available starting next week, as we lead to its release. We''ve been steadily working away on this project, and we''re excited to see what everyone thinks of what we''ve produced.

 	<br>

	In the coming weeks we''ll also be releasing a Source revived version of Half-Life 1: Deathmatch. People who already own Half-Life 1: Source will receive this as a free download.

 	<br><br>

	Next Saturday, Valve''s CEO and founder, Gabe Newell, will be giving the commencement speech at Southern Methodist University''s <i>Guildhall</i>, a university program offering course work in game design. Two groups of students enrolled in the program will be releasing the Source MODs they produced during their term. More information on the games they''ve built is available on their websites:

 	<br><br>

	Eclipse: <a href="http://students.guildhall.smu.edu/eclipse/">http://students.guildhall.smu.edu/eclipse/</a>

	<br>Samurai Legends: <a href="http://students.guildhall.smu.edu/samurailegends/">http://students.guildhall.smu.edu/samurailegends/</a>

	<h1>Friday, June 17 2005</h1>

	<br>

	For the last couple of months a team at Valve has been working away on Day of Defeat: Source. We''d like to give people some insight into what we''ve been doing during this time.<br>

	<br>

	The initial plan following the launch of Half-Life 2 was to get a near direct port of the existing Day of Defeat up and running and release it to the community. After this release, the plan was to take the approach of iterating on the art and gameplay of Day of Defeat through the end of the year. We finished this porting work a few months ago, released this version to a small group of beta testers, and then took stock of where we were. We didn''t feel like the game was good enough from a visual perspective to release.<br>

	<br>

	<a href="June17.2005/img/dod01.jpg"><img align="left" height="90" width="120" src="June17.2005/img/dod01_small.jpg" style="margin-right:8px;"></a>

	We decided to rework all of the content of Day of Defeat: Source before the full public release, hoping that people would be happier waiting for the product to ship while we gave DoD the attention it deserved. We hope our assumptions turn out to be accurate.<br>

	<br>

	Here is the first screenshot from dod_flash, which is the first map that has been given this complete art pass. We''ll have more things to share over the next few weeks.<br>



	<br>

	In other news, our friends at Softimage are having a modeling contest and offering $25,000 in prizes for the most original and compelling characters produced with the XSI Mod Tool. Submissions will be judged in-game on specific visual and animation criteria. For more, head to the contestï¿½s <a href="http://www.softimage.com/challenge">offical page</a>.<br>

	<br>

	We''re getting much closer to having Lost Coast ready to release. Originally planned as a section of the Highway 17 chapter of Half-Life 2, Lost Coast is a playable technology showcase that introduces High Dynamic Range lighting to the Source engine.<br>

	<br>

	Once Lost Coast is released, we will include HDR in our future product releases. For instance, Day of Defeat: Source will feature HDR lighting for all of its levels the day it is released.<br>

	<br>

	One of the fundamental pieces of HDR rendering lies in "dynamic tonemapping." In the Source engine, by varying the exposure of a scene based on how much light is visible, we can accurately simulate a range of brightness that is beyond what a computer monitor is physically capable of displaying. A real-world example of this effect happens every time you walk from a very dark room to an outdoor area with very bright sunlight -- your eye takes a few moments to adjust to the variance in the amount of light hitting the retina. If you have a video card that supports HDR, you''ll be able to see this in the engine when Lost Coast is released.<br>

	<br>

	<a href="http://storefront.steampowered.com/video/LostCoastHDR.wmv"><img width="180" height="135" style="margin-right:8px;" src="June24.2005/img/LostCoastHDR.gif" align="left" alt="Lost Coast HDR video - 12MB - Windows Media format" title="Lost Coast HDR video - 12MB - Windows Media format"></a>Static screenshots of HDR fail to capture this effect, but if you click on this image you can watch it happen in a scene from the Lost Coast. Note that the left-hand side of the screen is running in Fixed Aperture (non-HDR) mode, and the right-hand side with High Dynamic Range.<br>

		We''ve chosen the three winners from the Half-Life 2: Deathmatch map competition. It was tough going through and picking the winners given the quality of maps that the community built, but we feel these three represent the best of the group.  The winning maps will be released sometime in March for everyone to play.<br>
		<br>
		We''ve also been watching what the MOD community is producing lately, and there are some very promising projects underway. Recently, we had the team from Dystopia up to Valve for a few days to  get their feedback on  the SDK and and help them with any technical issues they might be having. Head over to <a target="_new" href="http://dystopia-mod.com">their website</a> to check out their work in progress.<br>
		<br>
		In news much closer to home, we''ve been challenged to a game of <a target="_new" href="http://hl2ctf.com">Half-Life 2: Capture the Flag</a> by the team that created this mod.  We noticed on their website that they want to "beat up on Valve" in a match that starts today at 6:00 pm PST. While our relationship with the MOD community usually involves us  providing tools and support, we''re more than happy to give them a beating in their own game. <br>

		Yesterday, <a target="_new" href="http://www.steampowered.com/index.php?area=news&id=403">a minor update was released</a> for Counter-Strike: Source, the Source engine, and the Source Software Developer''s Kit. Launching (or restarting) Steam will automatically get the updates.<br>
		<br>
		Also this week, many of us at Valve are attending the Game Developer''s Conference in San Francisco. It''s always nice to be able to compare notes with people in the industry, but this year we''ve been very honored to receive several of the Game Developer''s Choice Awards for <a target="_new" href="http://half-life2.com">Half-Life 2</a>. These awards are especially meaningful to us, so we''re feeling very grateful.<br>
		<br>
		We hope everyone playing Counter-Strike: Source is enjoying the new maps cs_compound and de_train. Coming soon, there will be another new map for CS:S called "de_port". As a teaser, here''s a sketch of the layout.<br>

			Next week we''ll begin beta testing the new Valve Anti-Cheat system. For people playing multiplayer games, there will not be any visible difference while we''re conducting the beta, but we will be logging cheating violations into our database to make sure it''s ready for general release. This will be the last public notice before the system is released and active for everyone. 

		<br>

		<br>

			If you have any cheats for multiplayer games installed on your 

			computer, now would be a good time to uninstall and stop using 

			them. When a cheat infraction is detected, the offender will be 

			permanently banned from playing on secure servers. 

		<br>

		<br>

			In lighter news, work is progressing on Lost Coast, that is the 

			level we''ve built to showcase a new piece of rendering technology 

			coming to Source called High Dynamic Range lighting, first mentioned 

			<a href="http://www.steampowered.com/Steam/Marketing/Feb4.2005/">here</a>.

			Valve''s Doug Lombardi will be showing the level on G4 TV next Wednesday, 

			March 30th. More information on the broadcast is available 

			<a href="http://www.g4tv.com/attackoftheshow/features/51399/Exclusive_New_HalfLife_2_Technology_.html">here</a>.

	Recently we refreshed the Steam hardware survey to get a fresh look at what kind of hardware the community is currently running. In this version of the survey, which many of you have already seen, we are gathering a number of new pieces of data. Now that we''re approaching 500,000 unique responses, there are a few trends worth noting:<br>

  <ul>

  <li>Most of you (88%) are running with a traditional CRT as your display device.</li>

  <li>The split between AMD and Intel processors continues to stay very close as it has in the past. AMD has a slight lead with 52% of the community''s processors.</li>

  <li>Nvidia and ATI video cards are the dominant providers, with Nvidia cards occupying about 52% of your PCs.</li>

  <li>Most of you have DVD drives in your PCs, or around 92%.</li>

	</ul>

	<br>

	You can also check out the <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.steampowered.com/status/survey.html">full results of the survey</a>.<br>

	<br>

	<hr>

	<br>

	Meanwhile, Introversion released an update to <a href="steam://store/1500">Darwinia</a> last week to add a difficulty system to the game. People who purchased the game should have a fun challenge trying to make it through some of the later levels with these higher difficulty levels.<br>

	As most of you know, using Steam to get new games is easy. Just browse for something interesting and pretty soon you''re saving Darwinians or driving a Russian tank.	But we want it to be even easier for you to decide which games might be right for you, so we''ve just added an important feature to Steam:<br>
	<img style="margin-bottom:16px;margin-top:16px;" src="March24.2006/img/metacritic.gif"><br>
	Starting today, games available for purchase in the Steam store will display their Metascore&reg; (from <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.metacritic.com">metacritic.com</a>), which is a numeric measure of the game''s critical consensus at a glance. The Metascore is created by taking a weighted average of critic grades. We really couldn''t think of a more honest, efficient, and independent source of information about game quality. We hope you agree.<br>
	<br>
	<hr>
	By the way! Congratulations to Introversion are in order, because their game <a href="steam://openurl/http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=8643">Darwinia just won the Grand Prize</a> at this year''s Independent Games Festival. Nice work, guys! (Hardly surprising; <a href="steam://store/1500">Darwinia''s Metascore is 85</a>!)<br>

	<h1>Friday, March 31 2006</h1><br>

	The months of April and May are looking like they will be two of the busiest months for Steam since the launch of Half-Life 2. First, we''ll be starting the preload and preparation for launch of <a href="steam://openurl/http://sinepisodes.com">SiN Episode 1: Emergence</a>, developed by Ritual Entertainment. This is the first in a series of installments set in the SiN universe that will be delivered via Steam. Next will be the preload and launch of the first in a series of episodic releases from Valve, Half-Life 2: Episode One. The preload for that will begin roughly one month before it is made available.<br>

	<br>

	Counter-Strike: Source and Day of Defeat: Source also have some new content nearing completetion. Counter-Strike: Source will see the addition of two new player models and an HDR enabled version of de_dust. Day of Defeat: Source has a new map on the way that will introduce a new gameplay mode.<br>

	<br>

	Lastly, we want to extend our congratulations to the <a href="steam://openurl/http://dystopia-game.com">Dystopia</a> team for winning the 2006 IGF Half-Life 2 Mod of the Year.<br>

  We''ll also be showing off some products at this year''s Electronic Entertainment Expo. Half-Life

  2 Xbox will be shown in the Xbox area of Microsoftï¿½s booth.  Meanwhile Half-Life 2: Lost Coast,

  <h1>Thursday, May 12 2005</h1>

  <br>

  This evening we''re planning for a major release of two new <i>Counter-Strike: Source</i> maps, along with a number of smaller changes to the game. This will be a fairly large download, so it might take a while for you to get all of the new content downloaded. It should be worth the wait.<br>

<br>

  The first of the two maps we''ll be adding is a brand new design named de_port, which focuses on giving the two teams a number of initial routes to take in a bomb/diffuse scenario. A couple of weeks ago we sketched out some of our intentions with the map layout, which you can go back and check out <a href="http://steampowered.com/games/css/strategy/">here</a>.<br>

<br>

  The second map we''ll be adding to the rotation is a remade de_inferno. As part of our effort to give the community more insight into what we''re doing here at Valve, we thought people might find it interesting to see how a map changes over its development cycle. To that end, we''ve put together a set of screenshots that were taken once each day during de_inferno''s development, taken from a variety of camera angles around the map. You can take a look at that <a href="http://steampowered.com/games/css/de_inferno/">here</a>.<br>

  <br>

  We are pretty caught up with E3 (the Electronic Entertainment Expo) again this year. Half-Life 2 Xbox is playable on the show floor, and lots of people are trying their hand at the Gravity Gun. We can''t wait to get the game into the hands of Xbox owners.<br>
<br>
  Our HDR (High Dynamic Range lighting) demonstration of HL2''s Lost Coast is also on display. This soon-to-be-released area of Half-Life 2 introduces a new character, whom we first mentioned (in the form of a concept sketch) <a href="http://www.steampowered.com/Steam/Marketing/Feb4.2005/">here</a>.<br>

	With just one week left before <a href="steam://store/380">Episode One</a> will be unlocked, we''ve started pushing out the final game
	pieces for preloading. If you''ve already started the preload, it should 
	be pulling the rest of the game down in encrypted form now. If you haven''t started 
	preloading, click <a href="steam://preload/380">here</a>. <br>
	<br>
	Yesterday we released the <a href="steam://store/912">first teaser video<a> for Episode One leading up to its launch, and it is 
	available in the media section of Steam now. While short, you''ll be able to see the second version 
	of the Source facial animation system, the new lighting model for the faces on characters, 
	and a feature we''ve added called dynamic scripted sequences that gives characters like Alyx the ability to have 
	more interactions with the environment.
	<br>
	<br>
	The <a href="steam://store/913">second teaser video</a> is available now, where you''ll get to see some more of this kind of 
	interaction with Alyx and zombies. Everyone will get the chance to see this first hand when the 
	game is released one week from today.

  <br>
We''ve seen an increase lately in the number of unscrupulous people acquiring Steam accounts (and access to Steam games) by stealing them from other users. These people accomplish their theft by simply asking legitimate users for their login information. This practice is known as "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing">Phishing</a>," and is found to some extent in nearly all online account-based systems.<br>
<br>
By posing as a Steam official in an email message, or sometimes by pretending to be a helpful user who wants to "trade" one account for another, the thieves are often able to convince people to divulge their user name and password.<br>
<br>
We know how frustrating it is to have your account stolen. As much as we can, we want to put a stop to this practice. To do that, we need your help -- please keep the following in mind:<br>
<br>
<blockquote><strong>Your Steam ID and password are confidential information. A Valve employee will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or email message. Do not respond to any message that asks for your password. Here is some <a href="http://steampowered.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/steampowered.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=301">more information about protecting your account</a>.</strong></blockquote><br>
In the meantime, happy gaming.<br>

		Last week we talked about some of the new content coming to Counter-Strike: Source, namely two new maps along with an expanded selection of player models. The first piece we release will be the map de_nuke, shown in the screenshot below. Also visible in the shot are the new Guerilla and GIGN player models. Before the map is released we''ll be adding High Dynamic Range lighting, so de_nuke will provide the first opportunity (for people who have capable hardware) to see HDR in Counter-Strike: Source. The map should be ready to go in a few weeks, and the new player models will show up shortly after Nuke is made available.<br>

Nuke will be the first Counter-Strike: Source map we''ve released that includes HDR lighting, and we think the community will like the way it looks.

This MOD team was the winner of the "Make Something Unreal" contest.

	You''ll notice some changes in the way Steam looks since the last update. Right now we''re working on what we call Steam 3 -- a collection of new features that covers everything from server robustness to support for third-party games. The first major piece we''ve updated is the organization of the games list and the Steam store. One of our primary goals with this change is to accommodate a larger and more varied collection of games. We hope everyone likes the newer look and feel of Steam.<br>
	<br>
	The next area we''re going to be focusing on is the Friends system. As such, Friends will not be available until the overhauled version is released. We will keep you informed of its progress.
	<br>

	Here at Valve, we like zombies. They''re dead, but they''re not. They have simple tastes. They pursue their goals with an unwavering, if shambling, intensity. Having populated Half-Life and Half-Life 2 with a variety of them, we hope (and suspect) you share our affinity for these unfairly maligned creatures.<br>

	<br>

	Of course, long before the denizens of the undead world began to grace <i>games</i> with their gruesome antics, they were already stars of the silver screen. So, this week we''re stepping outside of our usual focus to tell you about our new favorite short film. It''s called <i><b>Zombie Movie</b></i>.<br>

	<br>

	A Valve employee named Mike Asquith is one of <a target="_new" href="http://2chums.com">2chums</a>, who made the movie. Its official world-premiere is tomorrow (Saturday October 15) at <a target="_new" href="http://www.screamfestla.com/sched2005/oct15.shtml">Screamfest L.A.</a> (click for show time and details), and we think that every Steam user in the area should be there. Ideally, attendance should reach call-the-fire-marshal levels. Be sure to say hi to Mike when you see him at the screening. (And just so you don''t feel the need to ask him personally when HL2 Lost Coast is going to be released: we''re shooting for the end of the month.)<br>

	This week we''d like to draw your attention to the work going on at <a target="_new" href="http://www.blackwidowgames.com"> Black Widow Games</a>, a long time Half-Life MOD team. They''ve just annouced "They Hunger: Lost Souls" a Source-based follow up to their "They Hunger" series of games. Head on over to <a target="_new" href="http://www.blackwidowgames.com">their site</a> to get a look at what they''ve done so far.<br>

	<br clear="all">

	<hr>

	Our current plan is to release Half-Life 2: Lost Coast next week. Lost Coast is a free level for everyone who owns Half-Life 2, and serves as an HDR technology demo based in an unreleased section of the "Highway 17" chapter of Half-Life 2.<br>

	<br>

	After Lost Coast is released, we''ll be working on getting some new content for both Counter-Strike: Source and Day of Defeat: Source, along with an update to the SDK, out the door. More info coming on that next week.<br>

	We hope everyone is enjoying Lost Coast. We''ve received a number of e-mails with positive feedback about the commentary system included in Lost Coast, so it''s a safe bet that we''ll look for ways to include commentary in future products.<br>

	<br>	

	We''re now going to be looking toward releasing some new Counter-Strike: Source content we''ve been working on. The next two maps coming will be updated versions of de_nuke and cs_militia, along with a number of new player models for both sides. We''ll give everyone a sneak peek at Nuke and some of the new models next week.<br>

	<hr>

Two weeks ago we <a target="_new" href="http://www.steampowered.com/Steam/Marketing/October14.2005/">mentioned</a> our affinity for all things zombie, along with the note that someone here at Valve had made a short movie on the subject. Zombie Movie has won Best Comedy Horror Short down at <a target="_new" href="http://www.screamfestla.com/">Screamfest L.A.</a> and we''re looking forward to delivering the movie over Steam soon. We think everyone will get a kick out of it.<br>

	<h1>Friday, September 2 2005</h1>

	<br>

	Day of Defeat: Source will be released this month. While we''re not quite ready to pin down the exact date of when it will be available to play, we are confident that it will happen in September. Once we do have an exact date and time for when the game will be activated, we''ll let everyone know.<br>

	<br>

	There will be a period of one week at minimum during which people will be able to pre-order and preload the game via Steam, giving them the ability to unlock and play at the moment it is activated.<br>

	<br>

	Day of Defeat: Source will be available as an individual purchase via Steam, as well as part of the Counter-Strike: Source retail package that will be available at stores around the same time. Half-Life 2: Silver and Gold package customers will automatically be able to play.<br>

	<br>

	In the meantime, here are two of the player models from the game -- the Allied Rifleman and the Axis Panzerschreck.<br>

	<h1>Friday, September 9 2005</h1>

	Preloading of Day of Defeat: Source will begin next week. It will be released and ready to play on September 26th. Once we get closer to that date, we''ll set an exact time for when we''ll "throw the switch." <br>

	<br>

	Preloading the game allows people to have the entire game on their hard drive in encrypted form so that, if already purchased or pre-ordered, it will be playable at the moment it is released. Dedicated server administrators will also have some time to get their servers up and running before the 26th.<br>

	<hr>

	There is also some pretty exciting news on the MOD front, where the team over at Dystopia is preparing to release a demo of their game today at 11:59 GMT. Head on over to <a href="http://www.dystopia-game.com ">the Dystopia page</a> to check out their release.

	We''re also planning a release for next week that will update the Source engine to the same version used for Day of Defeat: Source. There are a number of small fixes contained in this release that we''ll cover in detail when it''s closer to release time.<br>

	Day of Defeat: Source is ready and we''re set to make it available on Monday, September 26, at 3 pm PDT. For those who have not yet pre-purchased the game, the 10% pre-purchase discount offer ends when it is released.<br>

	<br>

	In addition to pre-loading DoD: Source, another good thing to do in preparation of its release is to update your video card driver. With HDR and other advanced features included, DoD: Source pushes the limits of the Source engine a bit harder than other Source games. Check over at <a href=http://www.nvidia.com>NVIDIA</a> or <a href=http://www.ati.com>ATI</a> website for driver updates, depending on your hardware.<br>

	Day of Defeat: Source will be available as an individual purchase via Steam, as well as part of the Counter-Strike: Source retail package that will be available at stores around the same time. Half-Life 2: Silver and Gold package customers will automatically be able to play.<br>

	<br>

	Finally, as we await the game''s arrival, IGN.com posted a <a href=http://pc.ign.com/articles/652/652450p1.html>preview</a> this week with a large collection of DoD: Source shots and video footage. Full reviews will be appearing beginning this weekend and web sites and in game magazines.<br>
