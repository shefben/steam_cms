Changes/Additions
	<ul>
<li> LvesKrovy  new infantry map featuring close quarters combat in a trench and forest environment</li> <li> Smoke Grenades for both German and Russian commanders</li> <li> Streamlined and enhanced some interface functionality to make it easier for new players to get into the game</li> <li> Merged in the UT2004 3369 optimizations to improve server and client CPU performance</li> <li> New tank cannon round switching system  this new system allows you to select the next round that will be loaded after you fire off the current round. This system more closely matches the real functionality of the tank cannons/ammunition of the period, as well as eliminating the double reload time issue where the player had to wait until the current round type was reloaded before switching to another round type after firing</li> <li> New win conditions (removing No Decisive Victory)  this feature change was requested by many players and clans/ladders/leagues. Rounds will no longer end in a stalemate if the time runs out before either side captures all objectives. Instead, the game will assign a winner based by evaluating the following set of criteria in order: which side holds the most objectives, which side has the higher total score, and which team has the most reinforcements</li> <li> The scoreboard has been enhanced with additional information included a total team score, total objectives held by each team, and the round time remaining</li> <li> The objective map now breaks out the primary (required) objectives from the secondary objectives to make it more clear what the players should be attacking/defending</li> <li> Changed the chat text color so that it will be more easily readable against more difficult background colors</li> <li> Tracers now start at the tip of the 3rd person weapon instead of appearing to come out of the players head</li> <li> Improved the 3rd person upper body movement while prone. The upper body will now be able to adapt better to terrain while prone helping prevent many of the times when 3rd person players would appear to be aiming up in the air in 3rd person while they were aiming straight forward in first person</li> <li> The 3rd person players now much more closely match where the first person player is aiming in regard to the pitch axis</li> </ul>
Bug fixes
	<ul>
<li> New default sound driver from Creative Labs that should fix the issue of having choppy VOIP while using the Hardware 3d or EAX sound setting</li> <li> Fixed players bouncing off of other players that were prone (This was making it very difficult to perform melee attacks on prone players)</li> <li> Fixed a problem where you could get telefragged by proning/unproning and crouching/uncrouching players</li> <li> Fixed a graphical glitch that would cause red squares on terrain where blood had splattered</li> <li> Fixed an exploit where commanders could call in artillery strikes on a position that they marked in a previous round</li> <li> Fixed a bug where changing stances or starting to crawl while switching to nades  could cause the grenades to get stuck unable to fire</li> <li> Fixed players being able to move thier view around for a short time after dieing when the bSpectateLockedBehindView or the  bSpectateFirstPersonOnly flag are set on the server</li> <li> Fixed players being able to switch their view to third person view while dieing when the bSpectateFirstPersonOnly flag is set on the server</li> <li> Fixed players being able to fly around the map while dead under rare circumstances when the bSpectateAllowRoaming is set to false</li> </ul>

Ammo is now dropped as belts or pouches which contain all of the ammo held for a particular weapon. This replaces dropping lots of individual ammo magazines which was cumbersome and made it difficult to choose what the player wanted to pickup</li> <li> Player ragdolls are now affected by explosions from grenades, artillery, and HE rounds</li> <li> New weapon pickup system. The player will now automatically drop their current weapon when attempting to pick up a weapon of the same weapon family (small arms for small arms, nades for nades, etc)</li> <li> Added an option to use the native (non-translated) role names which we had in previous releases. Under Configuration-&gt;Hud check the \"Use Native Role Names\" box to enable this feature</li> <li> New custom death icons for panzerfaust kills and sniper kills</li> <li> Russian language localized version</li> <li> Fire mode icon for weapons with selectable fire modes (STG44)</li> <li> Rendering optimizations for Lyes Krovy</li> <li> If a player attempts to mark an artillery position on a level where there is no artillery   for their team they will now receive a message letting them know that their is no artillery available. This makes it clearer for new players why they can\'t call in arty on some maps</li> <li> Players that are not commanders will no longer get \"Press Use To Call Arty\" messages from artillery radios</li> <li> PTRD Soldiers (PT Soldat) now get binoculars to assist in spotting long range targets</li> <li> Made the STG44 fire animations appear smoother</li> </ul>

The file should now be called ROMod.ini</li> <li> Fixed a bug where you could not set rally points or mark artillery positions with binoculars in the commander seat of the T34/76</li> <li> Fixed an animation issue with the STG44 and the MG34 where they would appear to \"jerk\" if the fire button was held down longer than the fire animation</li> <li> Fixed an exploit where the iron sight animation could be frozen in place on semi automatic weapons or semi auto fire modes</li> <li> Fixed a bug where if you fired the coaxial MG on a tank turret until it reloaded after your primary ammo was out, it would instantly consume all of your coaxial MG ammo</li> <li> Fixed a bug where weapons and ammo would be picked up automatically if you were touching them when they disappeared</li> <li> Fixed a bug where if you dropped a weapon while you had a weapon on your back, the weapon would remain showing on your back, even though it was actually in your hands</li> <li> Fixed a collision issue where you could fire a tank shell through the lower part of the Panther\'s turret and it would pass right through without doing any damage</li> <li> Fixed a bug where you could get in \"invisible\" bayonet if trying to mount the bayonet during charging the butt smack</li> <li> Fixed various bayonet exploits</li> <li> Fixed an exploit where you could instantly mount/dismount a bayonet by pressing the bayo attach button while changing weapons</li> <li> Fixed a problem where the team channel selection button would not work in the French language version.

Changes/Additions
	<ul>
<li> All new map from Tripwire Interactive  Krivoi Rog. This map is an all out long range tank slugfest featuring a playable area over 4 kilometers long by 4 kilometers wide and a viewable range of 3000 meters. Set on the plains of the southern Ukraine the level pits the heavily armored Tiger and early war Panzers against the speedy T34/76. This is the first official Tripwire Interactive map to take advantage of the engine enhancements released with the last update which allow for rendering much longer view distances.</li> <li> All new adaptive bloom system - The game now features an all new adaptive bloom system that aside from looking amazing also simulates the effect of the eye adjusting when looking at bright areas. For those of you that experienced a \"blurry\" effect with the old bloom system (especially at low resolution) you\'ll be happy to hear that the all new bloom effect is crystal clear even at low resolutions.</li> <li> Added Anti-Aliasing and Anistropic Filtering settings to the in-game display settings.</li> <li> New tank variant  the Panzer IV G</li> <li> Added Manual Tank Shell reloading that allows the selection of round type prior to loading it into the cannon. This is a client side option.</li> <li> New system for locational and damage type specific pain and death sounds. For example, shooting someone in the head will result in a quieter death sound, while shooting them in the lower torso will result in a loud screaming death sound.</li> <li> Added Forgive TK system. Players can now say \"np\" or \"forgive\" when they are TKed and this system is enabled. This is a server side option which will be on by default.</li> <li> German half track machine gunner now has the ability to rise up to look over the gun/shield.</li> <li> Added a screen shaking/blurring effect when a player is hit by a melee attack.</li> <li> Engine enhancement to support much larger terrain sizes.</li> <li> Added an option to turn off in-game music, but leave menu music on.</li> <li> Integrated a tank obliteration effect for tanks/cars/vehicles that plays when their ammo depots are penetrated.</li> <li> Gave Machine Gunner Roles binoculars.</li> <li> A message is now displayed when attempting to reload or fire a bipod weapon letting the player know that they need to be deployed to perform these actions.</li> <li> New Loading Screen images.</li> <li> Added a forced team balance system which will swap players to the other team when they die if teams are unbalanced. This is a server side option.</li> <li> Added a Max Team Difference setting for server admins to allow admins to specify the player difference between team sizes (before it was hard coded at 2).</li> <li> Added per map Round Limit and Win Limit settings to WebAdmin.</li> <li> Added ability to add bans by ROID in Web Admin (used to only allow IP).</li> <li> Added AdminLoginSilent command.

This allows idle kicking to be much more useful, as before idle kicking only took into account movement. This was problematic for players with deployed MGs, sniping, or any other role where they could be stationary, but still actively playing.</li> <li> Added a server option to show IP, Time, and Date on the Scoreboard.</li> <li> Added 10 second countdown timer and messages that display when the ResetGame command is used.</li> <li> Added Max Players Override, which allows admins limit the number of players allowed into a server to a setting lower than Max Players setting. This will also scale the number of reinforcements accordingly.</li> <li> RO-Berezina:
- Set all area volumes precedence.
- Minor visual bugs.
- Removed bed from CP attic to avoid players clipping onto roof.
- Vehicle placements adjusted.</li> <li> RO-Kryokovo:
- Corrected blocking volumes along tree lines to prevent exploit.

- Performance improvements.
- Reinforcement tweaks - added slightly more Russian reinforcements.

- Changed all tank respawn times from 20 seconds to 30.
