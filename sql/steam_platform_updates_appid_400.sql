<p>Portal is a new type of single player game that changes how players approach, manipulate, and surmise the possibilities of any given environment in a manner similar to how the Gravity Gun changed our approach to how an object may be leveraged in any given situation. <br/><br/><img src=\"http://www.steampowered.com/img/pointpoint.gif\"/> <a href=\"http://storefront.steampowered.com/v2/index.php?area=game&amp;AppId=922&amp;\">view the first Portal trailer</a></p>

<p>The first of the Team Fortress 2 character shorts, Meet the Heavy, <a href=\"index.php?area=game&amp;AppId=994\">has been translated to Russian</a>. Now you (and millions of his homelanders) can hear Heavy\'s deepest thoughts in his own words, in his own way, in his first language. <br/><br/>Team Fortress 2 is the multiplayer component of The Orange Box, a unique collection of new games from Valve for the PC and Xbox 360. The PC edition of The Orange Box - which also features Half-Life 2: Episode Two, Portal, as well as the complete Half-Life 2 experience to date - is now available for <a href=\"index.php?area=package&amp;SubId=469\">pre-purchase via Steam </a> through October 10th for 10% off the $49.95 regular price.</p>

<p>Valve is pleased to announce the official \'uncrating\' of <a href=\"http://www.steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=package&amp;SubId=469\">The Orange Box</a>, now available on Steam. <br/><br/>The Orange Box features three top-rated new games by Valve: Half-Life® 2: Episode Two, the second installment in the Half-Life 2 episodic trilogy; Team Fortress® 2, the sequel to the game that put class-based, multiplayer team warfare on the map; and Portal, the game that blends puzzles, first person action, and adventure gaming to produce an experience like no other. <br/><br/>To bring gamers up to date with the Half-Life 2 universe, The Orange Box also includes Half-Life 2, the best-selling and highest-rated action game series of all time, and the episodic debut Half-Life® 2: Episode One—together, more than 30 hours of award-winning gameplay. Purchasers of the PC version of The Orange Box who already own Half-Life 2 and Half-Life 2: Episode One can conveniently “gift” them to a friend from within Steam. <br/><br/>All games included in <a href=\"http://www.steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=package&amp;SubId=469\">The Orange Box</a> are available separately or as part of two exclusive Steam collections: <a href=\"http://storefront.steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=package&amp;SubId=479\">The Source Premier Pack</a> and <a href=\"http://storefront.steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=package&amp;SubId=478\">The Valve Complete Pack</a>.</p>
