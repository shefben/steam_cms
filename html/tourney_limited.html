<h3>WHAT IS A LIMITED GAME TOURNAMENT LICENSE AND WHY DO I NEED ONE?</h3> 

All tournaments where Valve games are played require you to complete and agree to the terms of our Limited Game Tournament License Agreement (Tournament Agreement).  Neither the retail licenses nor the Steam Subscriber Agreement terms allow a licensee to host a tournament.  The Tournament Agreement is free and grants you the license to use and display identified games (Games) in your tournament.  <a href="/?area=tourney_limited_license" target="_blank">Click here</a> to view a complete version of the Agreement.<br>
<br>
The Tournament Agreement grants you the right to use the Games to do the following activities: 

<ul>
	<li> Operate and use the Game(s) during the licensed tournament.
	<li> Publicly display and publicly perform the Game(s) during the tournament.
	<li> Record Game play at the tournament, and distribute and sublicense such recording for private linear viewing only.
	<li> Promote the use of the Game(s) in connection with the tournament. You may only use copies of the Game(s) that you have properly acquired and licensed, at retail or via Valves Steam distribution system.
</ul>

You should consider whether you need permission from tournament participants, the tournament venue, or other third parties to exercise any of these rights.<br><br>
