Valve's Official Cyber Caf&eacute; Program makes things simple for the caf&eacute; owner.<br>
<br>
<h3 style="text-transform:uppercase;">One low monthly fee</h3>
For a low monthly fee per licensed computer, your caf&eacute; gets access to all of Valve's games. See the <a href="cybercafe_program.php">full list of Features and Benefits</a> for the details of what's included. Payment is handled in three-month blocks, in advance, either by recurring automatic billing or by invoice. <!-- For full details about licensing, payment, and the details of the Caf&eacute; Program, please see the official <a href="cafe_signup.php">Valve Cyber Caf&eacute; Agreement</a>. --><br>

<h3 style="text-transform:uppercase;">APRIL CYBER CAF&Eacute; PROMOTION</h3>
During the month of April 2004, Valve is extending a <a href="/?area=cybercafe_promotion">special offer to Cyber Caf&eacute;s</a>.

<h3 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Fully licensed software</h3>
Software purchased at retail is not licensed for commercial use such as cyber caf&eacute; play. If you operate a gaming center, our program is the legal way to obtain a commercial license and offer Valve's games to your customers.<br>
<br>
<h3 style="text-transform:uppercase;">As Always, Tournament Licenses Are Free</h3>
If you'd like to host a LAN event or competition, just <a href="mailto:cafe@valvesoftware.com">let us know</a> and we'll issue you a Tournament License, free of charge.<br>
