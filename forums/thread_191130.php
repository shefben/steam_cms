	<p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" >Ok people, I've had enough.  Every day I log on to Steam to see what's new, and every day I see several new people coming to the forums crying about the no-start problem.  As such, I've decided to start an official thread where we can post all suggestions that we've tried (and failed at) and any new suggestions that come our way in addition to our specs.  This thread will be an enourmous help to not only get Valve's attention regarding this rather gargantuan problem but also in getting them to fix it.  Before I start, I'd just like everyone to know that I have to break this post into FOUR parts as the entire thing is much too big to fit into one post.  So, here goes:<br />
<br />
<b>THE PROBLEM</b><br />
<br />
The problem this thread is about is the no-start/load/run problem occurring ONLY with the retail versions of Half-Life 2 (both CD and DVD versions, North American and European).  This problem is characterized by a window appearing and stating:<br />
<br />
<b>"Preparing to load Half-Life 2/Half-Life: Source/Counter-Strike: Source..."</b><br />
<br />
when the respective program is initiated (whether it's initiated from the Steam Play Games menu or from the Desktop shortcut makes no difference at all).  After a few brief seconds, the window will disappear and the CD/DVD drive will spin up the disc, but then nothing will happen.  No game will load and no error message is received.  Nothing happens whatsoever (beyond the window appearing/disappearing and the CD/DVD drive being accessed).<br />
<br />
For some reason, the autorun on the disc(s) work and the game installs without any major problems, but when booting the games, you cannot get past the CD/DVD drive access phase.<br />
<br />
If you are having this problem, please continue below.  <font color="red">If you are also having disc authentication and/or <b>"Please insert disc into drive"</b> errors, please continue below to <b>SUGGSETED SOLUTION #7</b></font>.  <i>If your problem with the game is </i><b>different</b><i> from the aforementioned scenario, </i><b>please do NOT post here requesting help</b>.  <i>Instead, please check out <a href="/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=182355" target="_blank">Half-Life 2 Knowledge Base for Retail Owners</a> for further help.</i><br />
<br />
<font color="red"><b>PLEASE NOTE:</b></font>  <font color="yellow">If you are having any of the following problems with the game:<ul><li>the game crashes <i>after</i> loading the game<br />
<li>you are having problems <i>installing</i> the game<br />
<li>you cannot start/load a new/saved game<br />
<li>you are having memory read errors<br />
<li>you are experiencing audio/video stuttering problems<br />
<li>the game crashes at autosave points<br />
<li>you are having problems connecting to Steam</ul></font><br />
<font color="red">THIS THREAD IS <b>NOT</b> FOR YOU.  Please seek help for these problems elsewhere.</font><br />
<br />
<br />
Now, to continue on with the thread:<br />
<br />
This no-start problem, as I will refer to it from now on, has been traced back to a compatability issue between the SecuROM copy protection employed on both the CDs and DVD discs and certain CD/DVD drives.  I am 99.9% sure of this and will detail why below.  I will list all of the suggestions provided to many of us by both Valve and Vivendi Tech Support and by various posters online.  If any of you are having the no-start problem, please go through the entire list of <b>SUGGESTED SOLUTIONS</b>.  If you are still experiencing the no-start problem, you can try the <b>UNOFFICIAL SOLUTIONS</b>, but do it at your own risk.<br />
<br />
<font color="red">Please Note:  If at any time while you are trying the below suggestions the game actually boots up and works, make a note of the circumstances under which the game booted.  When you eventually exit the game, try restarting the game again using the same conditions.  If it boots, exit the game and try again.  Keep doing this until you are sure that you can get the game to load consistently.<br />
<br />
The reason for this is that every once in a while, the CD/DVD drive will be able to get past the SecuROM protection and boot.  However, this is very rare and unpredictable, so if you find that you've managed to get the game to boot once but not again under the same circumstances, it means you haven't achieved anything in terms of solving the greater problem, you just got lucky that one time.</font><br />
<br />
<br />
<b>SUGGESTED SOLUTIONS</b><br />
<br />
<i>1.  Make sure your computer meets the system requirements to play the game</i><br />
<br />
Make sure your computer meets ALL the system requirements to play the game.  However, given how forgiving they are for this game, I'm sure most of us don't have a problem here.<br />
<br />
<br />
<i>2.  <ul><li>Is the game completely installed and validated?<br />
<li>Has the CD-Key been properly registered?<br />
<li>Have you downloaded all the latest patches?</ul></i><br />
<br />
Make sure you have done all of the above.  When you first install the game, you'll be prompted to register the CD-Key through Steam.  If you get any errors, don't worry, you can always try registering the CD-Key later using the Browse Games function in Steam.<br />
<br />
In the <b>Play Games</b> menu, right-click the game you want to play and select <b>Properties</b>.  It will tell you how much of the game you have acquired and if the game is ready ready for offline mode or not.  Please note: if the game is not 100% ready for offline mode, you probably won't be able to run it.  If the game does not say 100%, there should be a menu item in the Properties window that says <b>Automatic Updates</b>.  Make sure that <b>"Always keep this game up to date"</b> is selected.  Then, right-click the Steam system tray icon (the one next to the clock) and select <b>Monitor</b>.  A window should open with the game's name, % acquired and the download rate for it.<br />
<br />
If you're game is stuck at less than 100% acquired and no updates are being downloaded, go to <a href="/index.php?area=news&amp;id=351" target="_blank">Steam Client Update Released Nov 19/04</a> and click on all the relevant links.  Your games will be validated and updated.  At the end of it all, your games should be 100% acquired and ready to play offline.<br />
<br />
If you still haven't acquired 100% of the game and/or it's still not ready for offline mode, please consult the <a href="/support.php/cgi-bin/steampowered.cfg/php/enduser/entry.php" target="_blank">Steam Support Centre</a> for further information on how to proceed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<i>3.  Delete ClientRegistery.blob and restart Steam</i><br />
<br />
Exit Steam.  Go to <b>Program Files &gt; Valve &gt; Steam</b> and delete the file <b>ClientRegistry.blob</b>.  Restart Steam.  After a short update, run the games.<br />
<br />
<br />
<i>4.  Make sure you have a clear connection to Steam</i><br />
<br />
If you have any Internet Security or Anti-Virus software running in the background, make sure that they are either disabled or are set to allow Steam/HL2.exe unburdened access to the Internet.<br />
<br />
Of course, if you are trying to play the game offline, this tidbit of info is rather pointless, as the no-start problem affects the game regardless of whether you are playing on- or offline.<br />
<br />
<br />
<i>5.  Update your OS with all the latest updates</i><br />
<br />
Many people have been experiencing problems due to using an older version of their OS.  If you are running any version of Windows and experiencing problems, make sure you run Windows Update and get all of the latest updates.  If you are running XP Service Pack 1, upgrade to Service Pack 2 (it's free just in case you were wondering) and get all the latest updates.<br />
<br />
<br />
<i>6.  Update your video and sound card drivers</i><br />
<br />
Make sure you have the latest officially released drivers for your video and sound card.  For ATI video card users, this should be Catalyst version 3.11.  For nVidia users, I don't know, but I'm sure you can check updates for both at their respective sites.<br />
<a href="http://www.ati.com/support/driver.html" target="_blank">http://www.ati.com/support/driver.html</a><br />
<a href="http://www.nvidia.com/content/drivers/drivers.asp" target="_blank">http://www.nvidia.com/content/drivers/drivers.asp</a><br />
Don't bother with Beta versions of drivers as they are <b>not</b> guaranteed to work under any circumstances, let alone running HL2 (that's why they're called Beta versions).<br />
<br />
Same goes for sound cards.  Go to your sound card manufacturers website and check for updates.  If you have an integrated sound card, check your system manufacturers website or your motherboard/chipset's website for any updates.<br />
<br />
<br />
<i>7.  If you have any DLA programs installed on your machine, remove them as they may be interfering with Steam/HL2's access to your optical drive.</i><br />
<br />
<font color="red">Attention:  Anyone who is receiving the <b>"Please insert disc into drive"</b> error even when the disc is inserted or the <b>"Cannot authenticated discs"</b> error, please read!</font><br />
<br />
If you have a CD and/or DVD burner, you probably have a DLA program, such as Sonic DLA, installed on your system.  This program allows you to drag-and-drop write files to writable blank CDs/DVDs.  It also seems to interfere with Steam's ability to communicate with the CD/DVD drive, especially if you have more than one optical drive.  You can uninstall this program in Windows by going to <b>Start &gt; Settings &gt; Control Panel &gt; Add/Remove Programs</b>.  Once the uninstall is complete, reboot the system.  Steam should now be able to access the CD/DVD drive.  Whether it will be able to get past the SecuROM copy protection is another matter entirely.<br />
<br />
<font color="yellow">For those of you experiencing the <b>"Cannot authenticate discs"</b> or the <b>"Please insert disc into drive"</b> error, if the above did not solve your problem, please check the <a href="/support.php/cgi-bin/steampowered.cfg/php/enduser/entry.php" target="_blank">Valve Support</a> and <a href="http://support2.vugames.com/hl2/search.aspx" target="_blank">Vivendi Support</a> centres for further details.  This thread is dedicated to the no-start problem and we cannot help you further with your problem.  Thanks for understanding.</font><br />

	<font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="1" > <b>Official HL2/CS:S/HL:S does not start/load/run/boot thread... (Part 2 of 4)</b></font>
	<p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" ><i>8.  Change the IDE/ATAPI controller settings (ie. DMA and PIO)</i><br />
<br />
I don't know what the significance of this is or how it's supposed to help as I've yet to hear anyone who's solved their problem this way.  Right-click <b>My Computer</b> and select <b>Properties</b>.  In the ensuing window, select the <b>Hardware</b> tab and click on the <b>Device Manager</b> button.  A Device Manager window should appear.  Expand (click the +) the <b>IDE ATA/ATAPI Controllers</b> device, right-click <b>Primary IDE Channel</b> and select <b>Properties</b>.  From the ensuing window, select the <b>Advanced Properites</b> tab.  This tab window should show you all the devices connected to the IDE channel.  Assuming you have more than one device attached to the IDE Channel, find the one that is attached to your CD/DVD drive.  (You can determine this by going back to the Device Manager window, expanding the DVD/CD-ROM Drives device, and right-clicking and selecting Properties for the drive.  Under the General tab of the enusing window it should tell you where the device is connected (Location 0, 1, 2 etc).  This location number is the corresponding device number in the Primary IDE Channel window).<br />
<br />
Change the Transfer Mode option from DMA/PIO to PIO/DMA respectively.  You may have to restart the computer for the changes to take affect.  In any case, once you've done this, trying running the game.  If it ultimately doesn't work, make sure to return the settings to how you found them.<br />
<br />
<br />
<i>9.  Make sure you don't have any CD/DVD cloning software on your machine</i><br />
<br />
Apparently, some games, like Doom 3, were written in such a way that the game will refuse to boot/install unless you remove all CD/DVD cloning software.  Examples of such software are programs like Alcohol 120%, CloneDVD, etc.  As far as I know, regular CD/DVD burning programs like Nero, Roxio and Sonic do not count as cloning software, but feel free to experiment with uninstalling your burning software.<br />
<br />
The problem here is that when booting games like Doom 3, it will tell you explicitly (or implicitly) with a warning message to remove any clone software from your machine before proceeding.  The HL2 no-start problem, however, gives no error message of any sort anywhere.  In fact, at the very least, neither Valve nor Vivendi have said anything regarding a no-boot clause in the game if there is any clone software on your machine, so we can only assume that HL2 is not set to detect such programs.<br />
<br />
Furthermore to the point, according to <a href="http://www.securom.com" target="_blank">SecuROM</a>'s website, it is quite impossible at this time to replicate it's copy protection, so Valve/Vivendi have little to worry about.  In addition to that, it states that cloning and CD/DVD drive emulation software <b>should not</b> interfere with the operation of it's copy protection system, though they admit that it's not impossible for conflicts to happen.<br />
<br />
<br />
<i>10.  Update your CD/DVD drive's firmware</i><br />
<br />
Go to either your system manufacturer's or your CD/DVD drive manufacturer's website to obtain the latest firmware updates for your drive.  To find out what kind of drive you have, you can obtain it from Device Manager (see #7 above) or using <b>System Information</b>, found in <b>Start &gt; Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; System Tools</b> and then selecting <b>Components &gt; CD-ROM</b>.  If you are lucky enough to have a firmware update available for your drive, follow the instructions on flashing your drive as provided by the firmware provider.<br />
<br />
If no firmware update is availabe for your drive, you're out of luck and will have to skip this step.  If you happen to have a Philips DVD+RW 8601 drive, there may be a way of crossflashing your drive's firmware and allowing you to play HL2 (see <b>UNOFFICIAL SOLUTION #2</b> below).<br />
<br />
<br />
<i>11.  Use MSCONFIG to find any programs that may be interfering with the operation of Steam/HL2 </i><br />
<br />
MSCONFIG lets you select and modify what programs are loaded during start-up of Windows.  You can find information on how to do this by searching <b>Windows Help</b> for <b>MSCONFIG</b>.  However, to give you a quick run through, go to <b>Start &gt; Run</b>, type in <b>"MSCONFIG"</b> and hit Enter/OK to load the utility.  I suggest you DO NOT touch any of the .INI tabs as altering them will alter those files, and the less you mess around with Windows, the better.  From the <b>Startup</b> tab select the <b>"Disable All"</b> option and then click OK.  All the startup items will be disabled the next time you restart Windows.  Once Windows has restarted, try running any of the HL2 games.  If they do not work, reset the MSCONFIG Startup settings to what they were originally (you can do this by selecting <b>"Select All"</b>, clicking OK, and restarting Windows).<br />
<br />
If, however, for some reason the games do run, go back to MSCONFIG and enable a small number of Startup items (about four), reboot and try launching the games again after the system reboot.  In this way, you should be able to determine which program it is that is interfering with Steam/HL2.<br />
<br />
<br />
<i>12.  Uninstall and reinstall the game</i><br />
<br />
An error of some kind could have occurred during your install of the game.  Best bet is to uninstall and reinstall the game.  To do this, go to <b>Start &gt; Programs &gt; Valve &gt; Half-Life 2 &gt; Uninstall Half-Life 2</b> (or you can do it using the Add/Remove Programs via Control Panel).  However, this does not completely uninstall the game.  It only tells Windows and Steam that the game is no longer available, but most of the files will still be on your harddrive.  To remove the game content off the drive, start <b>Steam</b>, go to the <b>Play Games</b> menu, go to the <b>Properties</b> of each game and select the <b>"Delete Local Game Content"</b>.  The Properties of each game should now say "0% acquired".<br />
<br />
Once all that is done, reboot the system and reinstall the game from the CDs/DVD.<br />
<br />
<br />
<i>13.  Defragment the harddrive</i><br />
<br />
Double-click <b>My Computer</b>, select the drive where HL2 is installed, right-click it and select <b>Properties</b>.  From the ensuing window, select the <b>Tool</b> tab and then <b>Defragment Now</b>.  The Defragment program will start.  If you can, select <b>Analyze</b> to have the program analyze the amount of fragmention on your drive.  This process can take anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes, depending on the amount of fragmentation on your drive, so please be patient.  When the analysis is complete, select <b>View Report</b>.  The report window will open telling you how fragmented your drive and it's files are.  What is most important here is to check it's recommendation.  If the report recommends you to defragment the drive, then exit the report and select <b>Defragment</b> to defragment the drive (if you have more than one harddrive, make sure the proper drive is selected before you proceed).  Defragmenting the harddrive can take a considerable amount of time, depending on the size of the drive, the amount of fragmentation, your CPU speed, and amount of RAM, so be prepared to wait several hours for it to finish.<br />
<br />
If, on the other hand, the analysis does not recommend a defrag, you don't have to do one.  If you have a small amount of fragmentation and want to defrag anyway, go right ahead, it won't hurt.<br />
<br />
<br />
<i>14.  Contact the Customer Service/Tech Support of your system's manufacturer</i><br />
<br />
Let them know what your problem is and ask for any assitance they can give you.  They'll likely suggest a lot of the same suggestions in this very thread.  Let them know all of the things you've tried.  They may be able to help you with special updates for your system or specific system hardware.<br />
<br />
But chances are, they won't be able to help, so don't be too disappointed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Once you have tried all of the above suggestions and you are still encountering the no-start problem, you can try sending an error report to Valve and Vivendi detailing all the things you've tried but to fix the problem but failed.  It's more than likely they won't be able to help you (beyond "buy a new DVD drive") but then that is exactly why I started this thread.<br />
<br />
Also keep in mind that the more of us that speak up regarding this problem, the better the chance for us to find a resolution to it.<br />
<br />
Additionally, you can also send an error report to SecuROM regarding your problem:  Go to <b>Program Files &gt; Valve &gt; Steam</b> and right-click <b>Steam.exe</b>.  From the drop down menu select <b>Launch Analysis</b>.  A program will load asking for permission to analyze the file and your machine.  Select Yes and the analysis process will start.  After a few minutes, a file called <b>AnalysisLog.sr0</b> will be created in your root directory.  Next, go to <b>Program Files &gt; Valve &gt; Steam &gt; Steam Apps</b> and perform the same process on <b>HL2.exe</b>.  Once complete, compress the two <b>AnalysisLog</b> files into a zip file (highlight both files, right-click, select <b>Send To &gt; Compressed (zipped) Folder</b>), attach it to an email file and send the email with a brief description of the problem to <a href="mailto:support@securom.com">support@securom.com</a>.<br />

	<p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" >Replies from Tech Support could take a while though, so here are some additional things you can try to make your games work.  <font color="red">Please be advised that there could be serious consequences from employing the following methods listed below!  I accept no responsibility if something happens to your system or your games upon attempting any of the following suggestions, so attempt them <b>AT YOUR OWN RISK</b>. </font><br />
<br />
<br />
<b>UNOFFICIAL SOLUTIONS</b><br />
<br />
<i>1.  Use the HijackHL2 crack</i><br />
<br />
The simplest and "safest" way to get a working copy of HL2 is to use the HijackHL2 crack.  I cannot tell you where to find this crack, but a quick search over the net will help you find the file.  Please note that there are many CD cracks available for HL2, many of which are very dangerous to use.  Some cracks out there don't do anything but steal your CD-Key and account information and such, so please be careful of what you download.<br />
<br />
As I stated, you want a file called HijackHL2.  It comes as a zip that contains about 4 or 5 files in it - three program files (hijackhl2.exe, hl2.exe, hijackhl2.dll) and at least one readme file.  Once you've downloaded this file, follow the instructions on "installing" it.  When you use the crack to play the game, <b>make sure to EXIT from Steam first and then physically disconnect yourself from the Internet!</b><br />
<br />
I do not know what Valve's policy on using this crack is, but it's possible that if they detect you using the crack they will, at best, put on you on a 1 year VAC ban (no online multiplayer play allowed on VAC secure servers, but single player still works), and, at worst, ban your account outright so you cannot play any of the games in any way whatsoever (you will have to create a new account and buy a new copy of the game to be able to play again).<br />
<br />
Then again, it's possible they don't give two <font color="orange"><font face="wingdings">&#251;</font></font><font color="orange"><font face="wingdings">&#251;</font></font><font color="orange"><font face="wingdings">&#251;</font></font><font color="orange"><font face="wingdings">&#251;</font></font>s, but that's highly unlikely given the way they've been cracking down on supposed cheaters and pirates so far.  So, you have been forewarned!<br />
<br />
You're probably asking now, given the consequences, why risk using the crack at all?  Well, there's a very simple reason:  if you use the crack and your games run flawlessly, it'll prove pretty much beyond a shadow of a doubt that, assuming you're not using a pirated disc, it is the SecuROM copy protection that is preventing your game from running (see more about this below under <b>THE SOLUTION</b>).<br />
<br />
If you have tried using the crack and the game worked for you, you may, at your discretion, include this detail in the ensuing error report you send to Valve and Vivendi.  This will definitely nail down the problem for them and force them to admit that people are having issues with the SecuROM copy protection.<br />
<br />
<br />
<i>2.  Crossflash your CD/DVD drive's firmware</i><br />
<br />
It is possible to crossflash some drives into other drives that have more stable support for SecuROM copy protection.  The Philips DVD+RW 8601 is one such drive.  According to several sources around the net, including the Steam forums, crossflashing this drive to a Benq 1600 and then upgrading flashing it to a Benq 1620 will allow you to run the games, as the Benq 1620 seems to have fairly solid support for SecuROM copy protection.  You can find details on how to do this here <a href="http://club.cdfreaks.com/showthread.php?t=110931" target="_blank">http://club.cdfreaks.com/showthread.php?t=110931</a> and here <a href="http://club.cdfreaks.com/lite/t-110931:" target="_blank">http://club.cdfreaks.com/lite/t-110931:</a> (just so you know, both sites provide the same information; I just posted both in case one page goes down).<br />
<br />
However, be warned that if you do crossflash your drive, ANY warranty you had on it will be voided.  As such, any future errors you encounter with your "new" Benq DVD drive will not be covered by your original wrranty and Tech Support won't be able to help you.  You also have to be very careful in how you go about crossflashing the drive, or, as someone earlier in the forums said so succinctly, you could end up turning your $100 DVD writer into a cup holder. <img src="images/smilies/frown.gif" border="0" alt="">  So, you have been forwarned!<br />
<br />
<br />
<i>3.  The gmsplittm.sys "solution"</i><br />
<br />
There is an unconfirmed report floating around the forums claiming that the no-start problem is being caused by a faulty file, gmsplittm.sys, found in the <b>Windows &gt; Temp</b> directory.  Deleting this file and creating a directory with this name in the Temp folder supposedly allows one to get around the no-start problem.  However, it seems that this problem only occurs in systems that actually run the HL2 games and THEN crash after startup, so it's very likely this problem will not help anyone with the no-start problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>THE SOLUTION</b><br />
<br />
Ok, now let's get to the gist of what we're here for.  The ultimate solution here would be for Valve to release an official No-CD/DVD patch to the game.  But how are we so sure that the problem is being caused by incompatibility between our drives and the SecuROM copy protection.  That's a very good question.<br />
<br />
According to the official <a href="http://www.securom.com/support_faq.asp" target="_blank">SecuROM</a> website:<br />
<br />
<blockquote><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="1" >quote:</font><hr><font face="times new roman"><u>How does SecuROM&trade; work?</u><br />
SecuROM&trade; uses two components for copy control: 1) Software, in the form of strong encryption, and 2) hardware, in the form of a special signature applied to the disc during manufacturing. The protected executable of a CD-ROM title is tied to the signature on the CD by an authentication routine executed at program launch (this can be customized as described under item number 7 below). If the original CD is detected, the program launches properly. If an illegally copied disc is detected in the local CD drive, the program will not launch and the end-user will receive an error message. SecuROM&trade; technology suppresses CD-ROM to CD-R copying, DVD-ROM to DVD-R copying, Internet image distribution, and professional piracy. </font><hr></blockquote><br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.securom.com/solution_how.asp" target="_blank">and here</a>:<br />
<br />
<blockquote><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="1" >quote:</font><hr><font face="times new roman"><u>How does SecuROM work? </u><br />
<br />
The SecuROM copy protection mechanism consists of two components: <br />
<br />
<ul><br />
<li>A unique SecuROM&trade; electronic keycode is added to the CD/DVD-ROM with the use of special glass-mastering equipment which was developped by Sony DADC. This equipment is installed at all SecuROM&trade; enabled replication plants. For a full list please go to  Worldwide Available. <br />
<li>The .exe-file of the software is encrypted in a way that it can read the electronic keycode, allowing the application to be decrypted and run normally. This encoding of the application does not require any special programming or even technical skills because it can be done automatically by using the Online Encryption Toolkit. </ul><br />
<br />
The end user will not notice the copy protection as long as he uses an original disc. <br />
<br />
The advanced SecuROM&trade; electronic keycode cannot be duplicated or copied, so the main application of any illegally copied disc will be locked and the program won't start. </font><hr></blockquote><br />
<br />
<br />
The problem here, therefore, is with one of two things:  either the EXE file that executes the SecuROM copy protection check is corrupt/erronous, or the SecuROM copy protection is incompatible with the CD/DVD drive.  But, assuming all CD/DVD copies of the game are identical, and seeing as how not everyone with the CD/DVD copy of the game is encountering this problem, and given the fact that we receive no error message (as it states we should if the disc is a copy), the most likely reason for our no-start dilemma lies with the latter reason:  SecuROM's incompatibility with the drive.<br />
<br />
Now, after talking to Valve Tech Support, the only solution they could come up with was for me to get another DVD drive.  However, I do not feel this is a valid solution to our problem.  First of all, many of you, like me, shelled out a lot of hard-earned money for this game.  Some of you, like myself, even went so far as to buy a whole new computer (not exclusively for HL2, but, whatever).  The DVD drive (and computer) that I have is brand new and works perfectly (except with HL2), and as such needs no upgrade.  Therefore, I don't see why I, and everyone else with this problem, should spend even more money on useless hardware just to have the game load.<br />
<br />
In addition, the SecuROM copy protection is not only redundant but needlessly discriminatory.  First off, the registering of the CD-Key and the CD-Key check each time the game is launched is copy protection enough for the game.  Even if it were possible to make 1:1 copies of the DVDs, it would not help at all as one would still require a valid and unique CD-Key for each installed verison of the game.  And if two people use two separate copies of HL2 and log into the same account at the same time, the account will be banned outright as it conflicts with the first clause of the EULA that states you can only have ONE installed copy of the game anywhere at any one time.<br />
<br />
Secondly, the folks who bought the games online via Steam do not have this problem.  In fact, their copy of the games is exactly the same as the retail, except they don't have to go through a disc authentication process at all, let alone at every startup of the game.  This we feel is rather unfair: why burden one group of customers with an extra level of copy protection and not another, especially when the extra level of protection is ultimately moot and causes many of said customers problems in booting up the game.<br />
<br />
Add to this the fact that many people with this problem have experimented with using the hijack no-cd crack and found that the game runs perfectly.  I think this pretty much hits the final nail into the coffin of this problem.<br />
<br />
<br />

	<font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="1" > <b>Official HL2/CS:S/HL:S does not start/load/run/boot thread... (Part 4 of 4)</b></font>
	<p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" >The simplest and most practical solution out of this mess, as far as I see it, is for Valve to release an Official No-CD/DVD patch for the game.  However, Vavle has so far refused to even acknowledge this problem whatsoever, let alone consider a fix for it.<br />
<br />
So, I'd like all of you out there who are experiencing the no-start problem with your game to try all of the <b>SUGGESTED SOLUTIONS</b> listed above to get your games to work.  If any of them work, please report it along with your system specs as described below.  If, however, they all fail to get your game to boot (ie. you keep experiencing the no-start problem no matter what you do), please do the following: <br />
<ol type="1"><br />
<li>Send a report to <a href="/support.php/cgi-bin/steampowered.cfg/php/enduser/entry.php" target="_blank">Valve</a>, <a href="http://support2.vugames.com/hl2/search.aspx" target="_blank">Vivendi</a> and <font color="white">SecuROM</font> Support.<br />
<li>Reply to this thread explaining that you are the no-start problem and list the following specs of your system:<ul><br />
<li>CPU manufacturer, type/model, processor speed<br />
<li>the amount of RAM in MB<br />
<li>video card manufacturer, chipset, model, and driver version<br />
<li>sound card manufacturer, chipset, model, and driver version<br />
<li>CD/DVD manufacturer, type, model and firmware revision (if you have more than one optical drive, list them ALL)<br />
<li>the city and country where you bought the game and whether it was the CD or DVD version which you bought (if you bought the game online from an overseas retailer, please state which one)</ol></ul><br />
<br />
If you are unsure about what some of your system specs are, you can find them by going to <b>Start &gt; Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; System Information</b> and looking under <b>Components</b>.  If you highlight <b>System Summary</b> at the very top and then go to <b>File &gt; Save...</b>, you can make a hard .NFO copy of your entire system specs.  Send this file to Valve, Vivendi and SecuROM along with your error report.<br />
<br />
Hopefully we can compile enough replies and information to get Valve's attention and sort this problem out once and for all.  There are literally thousands of people out there experiencing this very problem, and the only way it seems we will get a resolution to this is by working together, not only amongst ourselves, but also with Valve.<br />
<br />
This will require much civility, and as such, I'd like to request that people refrain from bashing Valve on this thread.  I understand how frustrated you are; rememebr, I'm in the same boat many of you are in - I bought the game the day it came out and I STILL haven't been able to play it!  But slagging off Valve is only going to get us ingored and ultimately not help our cause.  So please take your frustrations out in another thread.<br />
<br />
I will be making periodic addenums to this thread at the end of the thread as I learn more about this problem and it's progress.  However, any important changes or updates to this very post will be made below, so please keep checking this post for any important updates.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you all, and may the Force be with us! <img src="images/smilies/tongue.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />

I have no idea why it works these times but no others, but it is really annoying. Seriously, there is no need for all this copy protection, the steam authentication and whatnot is enough, all the extra protection is doing is stopping legitimate users playing the game. Using the NoCD crack probably would work, but there's no way I'm going to risk getting my account banned.<br />

I just hope Valve release a fix/workaround for this.</font></p>

What's really sad is that it's been a week since I sent SecuROM my report and I have yet to hear back from them.  Vivendi support has only repsonded ONCE to my report, telling me to delete the ClientRegistry.blob file and restart Steam.  Not to be rude here, but I get the feeling they were just blowing me off.  I mean, you'd think that if I spent hours writing a 2000+ word error report I'd have at least tried that suggestion already.  Now I'm somewhat concerned as to what their next suggestion will be, if they ever bother to respond, of course;  perhaps they'll tell me to make sure my PC is plugged in and powered up? <img src="images/smilies/tongue.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />

Hello Everybody, my friend has bought me a Half-Life2 from another country, and he is going to send it to me later on and he helped me to register the HL2 and CS:S in his computer, then he have played for around 2 days, and he told me to get into that account (we talked in MSN) because he said the HL2 is so cool and he wants me to play it before the disc is sent to me, then i log in the steam and download the HL2 and CS:S from Steam and i was very excited because i have fnished downloading the 4GB Half-Life2........"Wrong CD inserted" an error message pop up after i double click the HL2 logo in my game list, i don;t even know what to do, the CD takes at least a month to ship it to me, but i want to play it now, please help, thank you very much</font></p>

<br />
CPU:  Pentium IV 3.4 GHz with Hyper-Threading technology and 800 MHz FSB<br />
RAM:  1024 SDDR RAM<br />
VIDEO:  ATi X300 SE 128 MB PCI Express using Catalyst 3.11<br />
SOUND:  Creative (Labs) Sound Blaster Audigy 2 (vanilla version)<br />
OPTICAL:  1.  Samsung CD-R/RW 252S<br />
                 2.  Philips DVD+RW 8601 firmware revision 6D11<br />
GAME:  Collector's Edition DVD purchased at the Best Buy in Markham, Ontario, Canada<br />
<br />
I have tried all the suggestion suggestions provided me, but nothing has worked.  The game managed to boot up ONCE and only ONCE (without the crack, that is; see below) and I have no idea how or why it did then but never before or since.<br />
<br />
I have tried using the hijack "crack" for the game and, not surprisingly, the game runs beautifully.  I have managed to talk to Valve Tech Support, but after much discussion, they could not help me; they told me to get a new DVD drive (sure thing; send me the money for it and I'll do it).<br />
<br />
So I'm stuck at this point.  Either play the game "cracked" or don't play at all.  Plus I can't play CS:S because I don't want to play the "cracked" game while Big Broth-err, I mean Steam is connected to the Internet. <img src="images/smilies/tongue.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />

	<p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" >wait for the cd, that is your problem, you are trying to play the retail version, and you need the cd to play that. Or you can do what I am starting to consider and find the HijackHL2 crack. This basicaly changes your ver from retail to steam so you don't need a disk to play. I wouldn't recomend this however because VALVe may shut down your account if they find out you have this and then it is realy game over. I am going to drive over to VALVe on Tues and find out the answeres on wether they are actualy going to fix the SecuROM issue, and wether it is ok for me to use a no-cd patch since I paid for the retail ver and cant play it. I am not going to try the no-cd patch until I talk to VALVe however. And I would recomend you all wait for my feedback before you risk loosing your acounts.</font></p>
