<br />
Now; if killer-koala and his army of retards really are right, then they should have very little problem proveing me wrong on all my statements contradicting their 'flawed' views.<br />
<br />
So to get started:<br />
<br />
<br />
My view on this subject is that the awp exploit is no exploit at all. If it were an exploit, I do fully belive that it would have been voiced long before now and thus fixed.<br />
<br />
As of now(pre latest patch), switching between the deagle and awp (other combos work aswell) does NOT remove the drawtime of the weapon. It does, however, disable the drawanimation.<br />
The thing is that the drawanimation and the drawtime of a weapon are two sperate things. This can be seen with many weapons even without a disabled animation. Watch as you draw your colt and fire. It will fire Before the animation has finnished.<br />
Undeniable proof that the drawanimation and the drawtime are two independant things.<br />
Thus, switching between awp/deagle will not remove the time it takes to fire. The same thing goes for all other combos. Try switching between knife/flash (or other grens) and you'll notice that even though the grenade drawanimation is not executed you can't throw your grenade instantly.<br />
<br />
In previous versions (pre 1.3) this what not the case. The drawtimer could be disabled.<br />
That Could be called an exploit, or it could quite simply be called a trick. All games feature tricks that the experienced player can master and gain an edge over his or her opponent. All games but Counter Strike. For in this game most things that takes skill to learn have been removed. Why, you ask?<br />
I say to make the game easier for newbies. This is not a new phenomena. It can be used to attact a wider audience to a game and hence sell more copies of the game.<br />
<br />
But it is hardly fair to the dedicated player that has learned to master all the tricks. All his practice will go to waste, just so that a new player doesn't have to put in as much effort in getting good at the game, as the original players did.<br />
<br />
As I stated above, Counter Strike is not the only game plagued by this phenomena, but there is no other game that has suffered from it to this extent. Not only in updates that simplify the game, but also in the fact that:<br />
Counter Strike is probably the least customizeable fps around.<br />
Correction: Counter Strike is customizeable, but doing so will get you banned from VAC. <br />
No custom models, no settings, no different crosshairs in different resolutions and the list goes on.<br />
<br />
It's absurd to see how far this game has gone in terms of making things even. It can never be even due to the fact that different persons have varying skill levels and that will never change.<br />
You wouldn't lower the basket in basket ball just because one team has a short player, now would you?<br />
<br />
This also applies for scripts.<br />
All I've got to say about them and the community's view on them is that this community is Exeptionally ignorant and narrow-minded. Most of you really need to see something else to get a perspective on things.<br />
<br />
To get back on topic:<br />
Suppose that this Was actually an exploit, it (disclaimer: caps) HAS NOW BEEN FIXED.<br />
<br />
Pre-patch switching between any weapon and the awp did not in any way disable the drawtimer, REGARDLESS of how fast you switch. To state anything else is just a show in ignorance of the game mechanics. It doesn't matter if your pistol is out for 0.001 seconds or 0.1 seconds. There will still be a delay between drawing the awp and beeing able to fire it. <br />
Capice?! (akta capstah <img src="images/smilies/biggrin.gif" border="0" alt="">)<br />
<br />
<br />
Now that I've successfully proven you wrong on one of the most common misconceptions and most used arguments, I will move on with the "but you disable the reload animation!" bs:<br />
<br />
First, to clarify things; the thing that you claim is disabled is not a reload animation.<br />
It is no more a reload animation than the way the slide of any pistol flies back when you fire it. The animation displayed inbetween shots. From that we can draw the conclusion that switching from the awp to another weapon inbetween shots, is no different from fiereing a pistol and switching as soon as you fire a shot. That would ofcourse not be very efficient because of obvious reasons that I will not go in to, and if you would like me to, well... then you're a retard and should see a doctor.<br />
<br />
A thing to remeber about these fiereing animations is that they have NO and I mean NO effect on the rate of fire of a weapon. As you can see when fiereing a pistol such as the usp rapidly, a shot will go off before the fiereing animation has time to finnish.<br />
That means that whatever animation is being drawn or skipped the rate of fire on the weapon WILL remain the same.<br />
<br />
There you have it. The AWP's rate of fire is not increased by switching.<br />
<br />
<br />
There are however other issues that are supposed to be 'wrong' about the way the awp worked pre-patch.<br />
It was suggested by killer-koala and his army of retards that it is unfair to gain mobility with the AWP, since you're supposed to get a decrease in speed when carrying it and to compensate for all the evil deeds commited by the quickswitchers, a player should have to 'reload' the weapon when it is drawn if he/she switches to disable the ANIMATION of 'reload'. This was quite often motivated by the realism factor. A factor which cannot be considered in a game where a player can take three shots to the head and where various other unrealistic things are possible. This is an arcade game which is supposed to walk on a fine line between action and realism. Lately, adding more realism has been used as an excuse to make the game easier to new players.<br />
Tell me, why is only realism added in such parts of the game that the it evens out the skill gap? If realism were the goal, then surely there are more important things to adress the ability for a weapon to function while it is not equipped?<br />
<br />
To continue finnishing off the start of the above paragraph;<br />
If a weapon's animation beeing skipped will result in a delay to compensate for that animation the next time the weapon is draw, why:<br />
<br />
1. Is not the animation drawn?<br />
2. Is it possible to shoot before the delay has finnished, but without zooming?<br />
3. Is is the delay in effect even though you have a fresh AWP that has not fired a single shot?<br />
<br />
One thing is certain:<br />
This new delay is not more realistic than the game mechanics pre-patch.<br />
<br />
<br />
To adress the absurd " if it's not an exploit that makes you shoot faster, why use it?" statements that have been pouring out of killer-koalas mouth (fingers?):<br />
<br />
Quickswitching has several advantages to the experienced player. They vary between the way you quickswitch.<br />
<br />
The first on is that you will get your pistol out very quickly and can thus engage anyone who got legshotted (you don't miss :P). While browsing through the soon-to-reach 100 page thread, I noticed players complaining about players using this technique while equipped with a deagle and supposedly becoming unstopable.<br />
<br />
Switching to your pistol is not cheating and people can still switch to the pistol and fire, so this update didn't deal with that.<br />
Secondly, if you get killed by someones deagle after that they missed you with an AWP and you didn't manage to kill them during all that time, you're not that good and it's not the game's fault.<br />
<br />
The second advantage with switching to the pistol occurs when you switch back to the AWP instantly is that you clear your field of view. Your view isn't obscured by that big crosshair, and you get better mobility.<br />
How fast you switch doesn't really matter (unless you're really slow) and it takes more effort to zoom in again than it would to not switch and let the game zoom in automaticly, so don't come crying about that.<br />
<br />
As for people that do unzoomed kills after switching:<br />
<br />
That actually takes skill (someone explain that one to me?)<br />
<br />
Secondly it is much more accurate if done Without switching (if don't let go of your mouse button after fireing you will shoot an unzoomed round as soon as the weapon is ready, and that round will be more accurate than a normal unzoomed shot).<br />
<br />
Finally, it is still possible in this new patch.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for only 'noobs' complaining about the AWP changes, realise this:<br />
<br />
Amongst the members of all serious (thus non-noob) community sites, these boards are know to be the state of the art 'noob' boards. The only people who aren't aware of that fact are the noobs. And don't say that bs, since you're the noobs so you wouldn't know anyway and besides, alot of things in life work this way.<br />
<br />
To support my claim I can say that many players of the absolute Elite (sry) of the Counter Strike competative scene, such as fisker, OPPOSE the changes.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading and spare me the flames (you're not worthy)<br />

<br />
I said:<br />
It isn't a reload<br />
It's part of the game mechanics since it has ALWAYS been that way and it is that way with EVERY weapon in the game.<br />
If it truely were an exploit, why isn't it fixed for all the weapons?<br />
Vavle did not correct the universal weapon code (such as a weapon not reloading if you cancel the reload anim, the REAL reload), but instead they added lot's of code and made the awp an exception.<br />
Why is that?<br />
To nerf it and make the game more noob friendly.<br />
Adding new awp code is more time consuming anyway<br />
<br />

when you quickswitch after awping, and it's "magically" reloaded, the game still registers the reloading, meaning you don't get any extra time (as krokko said).  this eliminates all advantages that quickswitching would bring, other than to unscope the awp and to get your pistol out.  how is this an advantage?  learn what a word means before you go throwing it around like a moron.</font></p>

And if it were an exploit, why wasn't it changed until a whorde of noobs who couldn't cope with the skill in it started whining on 50 pages in these forums?<br />
Please TELL ME THAT </b><hr></blockquote> <br />
Wow, you're dense. 3-4 people just proved your argument invalid through comparing it to absurdity. Reread the page.<br />
<br />
The noscope exploit only applies to very slow ROF weapons with no zoomed crosshair. Only the AWP and Scout fall under that category. And you've got it backward; it wasn't until after the change that noobs who couldn't cope with the <i>real</i> skill involved in using the AWP started whining.<br />
<br />
It <b>was</b> an exploit, because it took advantage of something that was not intended to be possible in the game. So was bunnyhopping.</font></p>

<b>exploit:<br />
tr.v. ex·ploit·ed, ex·ploit·ing, ex·ploits (k-sploit, ksploit)<br />
To employ to the greatest possible advantage.  (dictionary.com)<br />
<br />
when you quickswitch after awping, and it's "magically" reloaded, the game still registers the reloading, meaning you don't get any extra time (as krokko said).  this eliminates all advantages that quickswitching would bring, other than to unscope the awp and to get your pistol out.  how is this an advantage?  learn what a word means before you go throwing it around like a moron. </b><hr></blockquote> <br />
if you quickswitch it dosent reload (the time isent important) you run for cover jump back and shot.<br />
<br />
if you shoot dont quickswitch you walk away slowely it reloads you come back and shoot.<br />
<br />
the exploit is your sprinting around killing with an awm and not letting it reload, you walk slow with an awm for a reason.....to make being on the wrong end of a 1 shot a little more fair.<br />
<br />
its made that way and you go abusing it then the developers will force you not to.</font></p>

<br />
The only thing that supposedly "proved me wrong" was this (nothing else with any content was posted before my post "3-4 people"  lol :/   get your math straight man): <br />
<br />
"how is stopping the gun from reloading then having it magically reloaded not a exploit? and the annoying thing is you instantly can sprint away and jump back to fire that magical bullet right where the cross hair is the instant you land. this wont end till the morons stop sharing the same single braincell and realise that is an exploit because it is one and valve officially noticies it as one by fixing it. i'll say this once more kids, cal does not decide whats allowed in cs they only have power over the matchs using cs."<br />
<br />
and I answerd that right below, so I won't repost it<br />
<br />
you do nothing but flame and say that I am wrong<br />
or perhaps that it is lame</font></p>

<b> First, to clarify things; the thing that you claim is disabled is not a reload animation.<br />
It is no more a reload animation than the way the slide of any pistol flies back when you fire it. The animation displayed inbetween shots. From that we can draw the conclusion that switching from the awp to another weapon inbetween shots, is no different from fiereing a pistol and switching as soon as you fire a shot. That would ofcourse not be very efficient because of obvious reasons that I will not go in to, and if you would like me to, well... then you're a retard and should see a doctor.<br />
<br />
A thing to remeber about these fiereing animations is that they have NO and I mean NO effect on the rate of fire of a weapon. As you can see when fiereing a pistol such as the usp rapidly, a shot will go off before the fiereing animation has time to finnish.<br />
That means that whatever animation is being drawn or skipped the rate of fire on the weapon WILL remain the same.</b><hr></blockquote> <br />
<br />
<br />
So I am asking this for clarification because I am not sure I understood your point exactly.  You are saying that when you shoot the AWP and switch to pistol then switch right back the AWP was not reloaded?  Or when you switched it to pistol after shooting and switched it back it then took the same amount of time to reload, after the switch, as it would if you never switched?  I am seriously asking to be clear.</font></p>
