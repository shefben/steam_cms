## Key Questions
1. What were the major design and layout changes between 2002 and 2009?
2. How did the navigation structure evolve over this period?
3. What kind of content was present on the site in its early years?
4. What were the key features introduced and deprecated during this time?

## Resource Strategy
- Primary data source: archive.org (Wayback Machine)
- Tools: `extract_content_from_websites` for HTML/CSS, `file_write` to save the content.

## Verification Plan
- Cross-reference information from multiple snapshots within the same year on archive.org to ensure accuracy.
- Look for any contemporary articles or news reports that might describe the website's features during that time.

## Expected Deliverables
- A structured directory containing HTML/CSS and content for each year.
- A markdown report detailing the analysis and comparison of the different versions.

## Workflow Selection
- Primary focus: Search
- Justification: The main goal is to gather and organize information from an external source.
