In addition, please note that we are unable to reset CD keys that have been banned by VAC.<br><br>To have us reset your CD key, please mail us the following (by postal mail, not email):<br>- The original printed CD key (ie, just the jewel case or cardboard sleeve with the CD key printed on it, not the whole package, and not the CD itself)<br>- Your email address<br>- The Steam account you want the CD key assigned to<br><br>Send your package to:<br>CD key reset<br>Valve Software<br>PO Box 1688<br>Bellevue WA 98009<br>USA<br><br>We are unable to return anything you mail to us.</p>
