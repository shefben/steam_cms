<p><h3><a href="index.php?area=news&id=106392647396669100" style="text-decoration: none; color: #BFBA50;">It's Alive!</a></h3>
<span style="font-size: 9px;">September 18, 2003, 4:07 pm &middot; <a href="mailto:greg@valvesoftware.com" style="text-decoration: none;">Greg Coomer</a><table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td height="1" width="100%" bgcolor="#808080"></td></tr><tr><td height="10" width="100%"></td></tr></table></span>
As <em>many</em> of you have noticed, Steam is back up now. Launching Steam and getting into a game should work just fine. Friends does currently work while playing a game, but not from the desktop. The Friends servers require some networking changes before they're fully functional again. We're working on this now.<br>
<br>
As always, get in touch if you have any questions.<br>
<br><br></p>

<p><h3>Steam Is Down</h3>
<span style="font-size: 9px;">September 18, 2003, 11:36 am &middot; <a href="mailto:greg@valvesoftware.com" style="text-decoration: none;">Greg Coomer</a><table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td height="1" width="100%" bgcolor="#808080"></td></tr><tr><td height="10" width="100%"></td></tr></table></span>
The Steam network is down right now.
We're working on a fix and should have everything working again shortly. Sorry for the inconvenience.<br>
<br><br></p>

<p><h3>Friends Downtime</h3>

<span style="font-size: 9px;">September 17, 2003, 5:31 pm &middot; <a href="mailto:ChrisB@valvesoftware.com" style="text-decoration: none;">Chris Bokitch</a><table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td height="1" width="100%" bgcolor="#808080"></td></tr><tr><td height="10" width="100%"></td></tr></table></span>
The Friends server will be down for the next day or so while we make improvements to it.<br>
<br><br></p>

<p><h3>Login Failures</h3>
<span style="font-size: 9px;">September 17, 2003, 1:17 pm &middot; <a href="mailto:ChrisB@valvesoftware.com" style="text-decoration: none;">Chris Bokitch</a><table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td height="1" width="100%" bgcolor="#808080"></td></tr><tr><td height="10" width="100%"></td></tr></table></span>
Some people might be getting the following message when attempting to login to Steam:<br>
<br>
<em>"Login to steam failed.  Either the specified account does not exist, or the password was wrong.  Please check your email address and password and try again."</em><br>
<br>
This is a bit misleading - your account exists and is fine.  The authentication servers are under heavy load right now.  This problem should be resolved shortly.  Thanks for your patience!<br>
<br><br></p>

<p><h3>A Note About WON and Counter-Strike 1.5</h3>
<span style="font-size: 9px;">September 17, 2003, 11:35 am &middot; <a href="mailto:ChrisB@valvesoftware.com" style="text-decoration: none;">Chris Bokitch</a><table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td height="1" width="100%" bgcolor="#808080"></td></tr><tr><td height="10" width="100%"></td></tr></table></span>
There seems to be a lot of confusion over the proposed plan to pull the plug on WON.  WON <em>will be available</em> until the Steam service is working the way it was intended to.  We will not simply pull the plug.  If you wish to, you can reinstall Half-Life (if necessary) and play Counter-Strike 1.5 the way you always have.<br>
<br>
I hope that eases some fears.<br>
<br>
Some of the constructive feedback we've received has been quite valuable, and we're working to create a product that everyone will be happy with.<br>
<br><br></p>

<p><h3>Status Update: New Installers to be Released Tomorrow</h3>
<span style="font-size: 9px;">September 15, 2003, 5:18 pm &middot; <a href="mailto:greg@valvesoftware.com" style="text-decoration: none;">Greg Coomer</a><table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td height="1" width="100%" bgcolor="#808080"></td></tr><tr><td height="10" width="100%"></td></tr></table></span>
Well, the release process last week and over the weekend was pretty rocky. The community managed to get 500,000 accounts created and are currently seeing about 15,000 people playing Counter-Strike 1.6 at any given time. We know that the conversion process has been anything but smooth for many of our users. We're going to get this fixed. We've done our best to support the Half-Life community over the past 5 years, and we're still committed to doing whatever it takes to make the community happy. We've listened to the response, and we'll be repairing the problems with Steam until it performs the way we all want it to.<br>
<br>
Tomorrow we will release new installers which include the cache files for all of the games available via Steam (Day of Defeat, Team Fortress Classic, the dedicated server, etc). If you haven't already done so, please use the installer that includes Counter-Strike and Half-Life.<br>
<br>
Here's what's going on at Steam HQ:<br>
<ul>
<li>We ran into some pretty serious bandwidth and server limitations after the release last week, which has caused several other problems like long wait times and UI unresponsiveness. The load is starting to die down now and we're getting more content servers lined up, so these problems are becoming less frequent. As more people begin using the new installers which include the game caches, their experience using Steam will improve greatly. If you're having problems connecting to Steam or launching Counter-Strike, please download the latest version of the installer and give it a try.</li>
<li>Some other Steam problems -- "JIT" error messages, expired ticket errors, etc -- will be fixed with a Steam update this week.</li>
</ul>
Other stuff:<br>
<ul>
<li>Counter-Strike 1.5 is still available, and will be for a couple of weeks. After we're confident that the Steam authentication servers are functioning as they should (and not before), we'll be turning off the WON servers and migrating everyone over to the new system.</li>
<li>There have been some reports of the Conversion Wizard failing during account creation. If this happens for you, please try downloading and installing the most recent version of the Steam client from one of the mirrors listed on this site.</li>
<li>We're preparing a new installer on CD for cyber-cafe owners. Contact biz@steampowered.com if you're interested in receiving this.</li>
<li>We've heard from several people who are having trouble getting their MODs working with Steam. We've updated our FAQ with new information about this. Check it out and then email us if you're still having trouble.</li>
</ul>
<br>
Feel free to get in touch with us you're having difficulty, or for whatever reason. Thanks for hanging in there with us through these first few days.<br>

<br><br>

<span style="font-size: 9px;">September 11, 2003, 10:06 pm &middot; <a href="mailto:greg@valvesoftware.com" style="text-decoration: none;">Greg Coomer</a><table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td height="1" width="100%" bgcolor="#808080"></td></tr><tr><td height="10" width="100%"></td></tr></table></span>
The <a href="http://collective.valve-erc.com/index.php?news=1063262607-73177700">dedicated server release</a> went out last night. See the full update history <a href="/platform/update_history/Dedicated%20Server.html">here</a>.<br>
<br>
We're working right now on finalizing the Steam Client, and will be releasing it soon.<br>
<br><br></p>

<p><h3>Steam Dedicated Server Release Tonight; Steam Client Tomorrow</h3>
<span style="font-size: 9px;">September 10, 2003, 12:07 pm &middot; <a href="mailto:greg@valvesoftware.com" style="text-decoration: none;">Greg Coomer</a><table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td height="1" width="100%" bgcolor="#808080"></td></tr><tr><td height="10" width="100%"></td></tr></table></span>
We've been making final changes to the Steam network throughout the night. Unfortunately, it's taken longer than we planned. However, the Steam dedicated server will be released this evening, and the Steam client release is now scheduled for tomorrow.<br>
<br>
We're working to get the release out as fast as we can -- sorry for the delay, and thanks for your patience.<br>
<br><br></p>

<p><h3>Steam Beta Ends Tonight</h3>
<span style="font-size: 9px;">September 9, 2003, 4:49 pm &middot; <a href="mailto:Erik@valvesoftware.com" style="text-decoration: none;">Erik Johnson</a><table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td height="1" width="100%" bgcolor="#808080"></td></tr><tr><td height="10" width="100%"></td></tr></table></span>
As mentioned last week, the Steam beta is now ending. The beta system will be offline at 5:30 PDT.<br>
<br>
A dedicated game server will be released later this evening, and the full Steam client will be released tomorrow (Wednesday) at 11:00 am PDT.<br>
<br>
We would like to thank all of the Steam users who have helped us test Steam over the past few months -- your help has been invaluable. We hope you continue to enjoy Steam and all of Valve's games.<br>
<br><br></p>

<p><h3>Steam status</h3>
<span style="font-size: 9px;">August 26, 2003, 1:23 pm &middot; <a href="mailto:Erik@valvesoftware.com" style="text-decoration: none;">Erik Johnson</a><table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td height="1" width="100%" bgcolor="#808080"></td></tr><tr><td height="10" width="100%"></td></tr></table></span>
The Steam beta is now drawing to an end. This means that there are some significant changes coming to the way that Steam will be run.<br>
<br>
The next major release of Steam will be the first step towards converting the entire Half-Life user base to Steam. This means that we will be resetting the Steam account database from scratch. After this, you will need to have a valid CD-Key to access games via Steam, so you will want to treat your Steam account as permanent. One CD-Key will grant you access to all of the games currently available in the Steam beta. The Friends database will remain intact, so if you create an account with the same name when the beta ends, you will retain your Friends list.<br>
<br>
The next step will be to release the remaining three Half-Life 2 movies, fix the remaining issues with the Riot Shield in Counter-Strike, and any remaining issues with Steam. This will happen almost immediately after the Steam beta ends.<br>
<br>
Some of the other features coming after the beta resets are:<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li> New version of Cobble reworked by David Johnston.<br>
<li> Full Skin support in Steam.<br>
<li> More detailed information regarding the cache file on your drive.<br>
<li> Vastly more efficient use of disk space and bandwidth in Steam.<br>
<li> New conversion wizard to make better use of existing content on your drive.<br>
</ul>
<br>
After this, we’ll release an update to the entire user base that will convert them to Steam. Hopefully, the majority of the community will have converted before this. This will happen roughly two weeks from the time that the beta period of Steam has ended. Keep in mind, this does not mean we will be stopping or slowing development of Steam or our games that run upon them.<br>
<br>
Thanks to everyone who has participated in the beta up until now. I’ll let everyone know when we’re ready for the next release here.<br>
<br>
