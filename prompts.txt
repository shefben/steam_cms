1. Weighted Feeler-Based Obstacle Avoidance with Stuck Detection
The PathFollower class implements a CS-style triple-feeler system and a StuckMonitor. This logic keeps the bot moving smoothly while recovering from obstacles:

// m_flNextRepathTime throttles repath requests
if (curTime >= nextRepathTime) {
    nextRepathTime = curTime + 0.5f; // repath throttle
    return false;
}
...
FeelerAdjust(pos, traceFn, to);      // steer using feelers
m_stuck.Update(pos, curTime, onLadder);
if (m_stuck.GetDuration(curTime) > 2.0f)
    return false;

The feeler parameters and weights are documented in PathFollower’s header:

static constexpr float FEELER_OFFSET = 20.0f;
static constexpr float FEELER_LENGTH = 40.0f;
static constexpr float CENTER_WEIGHT = 0.5f;
static constexpr float SIDE_WEIGHT   = 0.25f;

Benefit: Bots can nudge around walls without excessive path recomputation, and the stuck monitor invalidates the path if progress stalls for over two seconds.

2. Objective Location System with CFFObjectiveTracker
The advanced navigation design proposes tracking flags and capture zones using an objective tracker:

## Phase 2 – Objective Location System
- Track positions of flags, capture zones and resupply areas using `FFNavEntity` data.
- Record dynamic objectives such as dropped flags every frame using the new `CFFObjectiveTracker` helper. Carried flags follow the carrier's position.
- Provide queries for nearby objectives via `GetClosestObjective` and `GetClosestObjectiveOfType`.

Example usage shows how bots could query the nearest enemy flag:

const ObjectiveLocation *flag =
    g_ObjectiveTracker.GetClosestObjectiveOfType(bot->GetAbsOrigin(),
                                                 bot->GetTeamNumber(),
                                                 NAV_FLAG);
if ( flag )
    bot->SetGoal(flag->pos);

Benefit: With a centralized tracker, bots always know the up‑to‑date positions of flags and capture areas, enabling accurate goal selection and path planning.

3. Dynamic Flag Tracking for Navigation
The navigation analysis notes that flag positions are periodically refreshed:

## Dynamic Flag Tracking
- `ff_bot_temp.cpp` now includes `Bot_UpdateFlagPositions` which refreshes `g_FlagPosition` every second. Bots reference this table when orienting towards their own or the enemy flag.

Benefit: Regularly updating flag locations ensures bots can react when flags are picked up, dropped, or returned, preventing outdated or incorrect paths.

4. Utility-Based Decision Scoring and Team Coordination
The CS bot port plan suggests replacing the existing state machine with modular layers and utility scoring:

- Replace the existing FF state machine with CS-style modules such as *TacticalPosition*, *ObjectivePrioritiser*, *ThreatAssessment* and *TeamCoordinator*.
- Assign scores to potential goals (capture flag, defend base, escort team mate) based on threat level, distance and current objectives. Choose the goal with the highest utility each tick.
- Use an FF version of `CCSBotManager` to broadcast events like flag captures or defensive callouts so bots can coordinate pushes.

Benefit: A utility-based approach helps bots dynamically choose between pursuing the flag, defending, or escorting teammates, while coordination logic keeps multiple bots focused on common objectives.













- for the admin sidebar, if i am on a page that is from one of the dropdown links in the sidebar, make sure when the page loads that the dropdown for that is still 'dropped' and not closed.
- fix the admin storefront product page by doing the following changes:
1. split the `system requirements` text box into 2 text boxes, one for minimum requirements and the other for recommended.
2. remove the screenshots text box and instead show each screenshot thumbnail, with its filename underneith and a `delete` button to remove it and a `hide` checkbox to hide it from the page
do this for each screenshot.
3. add 2 new text boxes with labels:
a. metascore url which will be inserted into the database
b. video trailer (this can be a external URL or a local path).
b1. add a button that allows the admin to upload a trailer for the product
4. add a 'Is preload' checkbox, when checked; the preload button on the product page which the users see should appear.  otherwise it should not be visible. 
this means fixing the gamepage.twig template to allow the button to be hidden or visible depending on the database column 'ispreload' for the product entry.
5. add a way to allow the preload button to be scheduled between two specific dates (month day year), if they are left blank, and the checkmark is checked, it will always show the preload button for the product.


- on the admin storefront product page, add a checkbox to hide the trailer box in gamepage.twig so it can be hidden.
- adjust gamepage.twig so the trailer URL can be hidden based on the information from the checkbox which is stored in the database.
- adjust the gameplay.twig and gameplay_with_metascore.twig so it shows the available screenshot thumbnails.  it is possible there are no screenshots available, in this case, nothing is displayed for the screenshots. 
 a maximum of 5 thumbnails can be displayed at a time. 


- game screenshots will be stored, uploaded and loaded from/in <cms root>/storefrom/images/apps/<appid>/screenshots/.
- game header images will be stored, uploaded and loaded from/in <cms root>/storefrom/apps/<appid>/headers/.
- remove parsing the <cms root>/storefront/templates/*.html  files from the installer scripts.
- go through packagepage.twig and ensure all tags have code to process the information correctly, grab the information from the database.
- /archived_steampowered/2005/storefront/browse_games_catagories.html


- add page numbers to the pagination in the admin cyber cafe directory page.
- add a dropdown to select the country they want to display the directory results for so they can edit them in the admin page


- for the 'random content' admin page, when the user selects the add button, show a textbox and label for creating the title to be used in the tag name for the randomized content.
- in the scheduled content page, make sure the 'new' table is smaller and fits within the body of the admin panel page, it overhangs on the left side edge.
- add the installer type style to the admin login page, so it is centered and looks like the installer page.
- in the header and footer admin page, fill in the logo dropdown with what ever logo is set in the database for the selected template

- in the header and footer admin page, when the user switches the template they want to change the header/footer settings for, do not reload the entire page, use ajax and update the content that way.
- in the header and footer page, make sure that the preview and url is set to the theme's images folder.  it currently tries to read it from <cms root>/cms/admin/themes which is incorrect, it should be <cms root>/themes/<selected theme>/images/
- if no file is selected for upload in the header and footer page, make the upload button unavailable until they select a new logo image.  make sure the logo gets uploaded to: <cms root>/themes/<selected theme>/images/ and is set in the database as well for the theme they are editing.
- in the settings admin page, allow the admin to create custom dropdown sidebar menu's.  this means figuring out a way to designate a entry as a parent and others as children to that parent.
- in the frequently asked questions admin page, add page numbers to the pagination between the next and back links.
- in the news admin page, add page numbers between next and back so the user can select specific pages.
-- also make the table sortable using the headers
-- turn the edit link into a button
- in the storefront developers admin page, turn the edit link into a button
- in custom pages admin page, turn both the delete link into a red button and the edit link into a button


- in cyber cafe directory admin page, add a dropdown to the 'add entry' widgets which lists all the countries.
- remove the theme dropdown from the content server admin page.
- fix the content_servers.php page so it displays everything correctly.  it should end up looking identical to the archived page from: `archived_steampowered/2004/2004_contentserver_stats.html`.
-- fix the content servers php page so this isnt displayed at the top anymore: `8];\n 8];\n`
-- make it so servers are broken into groups by their country, as shown in the archived page `archived_steampowered/2004/2004_contentserver_stats.html`.
-- total avilable bandwidth should be all the capacity's added together of each server entry
-- total used bandwidth should be 0 right now.
-- the yellow line represents the used capacity of each server, the black line represent the available.  the max available capacity should be 1000 per server, which means the black bar goes all the way across (like it currently does).  if a server only has 500 then the black bar should be half the length of servers black lines that have 1000 available capacity




- analyze all the php and html contents within `archived_steampowered/2004/storefront`, this is the 2004 and 2005_v1 storefront, it is seperate from the normal storefront.
- the code needs to be moved to `<cms root>/04-05v1_storefront/`, but when the current cms theme is set to 2004 or 2005_v1, the url should show as and be accesible as `127.0.0.1/<cms root>/storefront`, otherwise if the theme is not either of those two, then /storefront should be the normal storefront.
- this code must not be changed at all, and all assets should be moved to both the 2004 theme folder and 2005_v1 theme folder using a python script. do not move the actual image assets, only create a script that will do it.
- this storefront should not use templates.
- scrape all the different games, game image thumbnails, game name, appid and description from games.php and store it in the database table `0405_storefront_games`.
-- change games.php so that it loads each game and its corresponding information from the database. 
-- each game section should get a 'capsule' using this html (there are html comments in the area's where each part of the games information should be placed):
`<div class="capsule" ;="">

1. add a checkbox to the `Delete` cell of each entry, when ti is checked and the user clicks save, the entry will be removed from the database.
2. replace the `Themes` text box in each table entry with multiple checkboxes, one checkbox for each theme which will be saved to the database as a comma seperated list of theme names of the themes that are checked.
3. rename the column header `Name` to `Title Tag Name`.
4. add a new column with header with the label `Custom Title Text` after the `Title Tag Name` column.

make this prompt by adding details, making it coherent and precise, do not include any code, just the prompt:

when the manage capsule button is clicked, an in-window modal window should become visible with a translucent surrounding background over the visible 
parts of the webpage.  this should open using ajax to avoid fully refreshing.
the new modal window will be used for graphically creating a tabbed content section, as shown in the image.

the modal window should show a single tab on the left side with a short content area attached to the bottom of the tab with a button thats labeled '+ add game entry'.
the tab should have an editable label  when the text of the tab is clicked, which causes the tab to grow and shrink based on the label length.
after the label on the right side of it there should be a '+' button, when pressed, it will add a new tab next to the first one on the right side, 
and move the button to after the new tab again it has an editable label.

each tab should have a content area underneath it, in the content area, at the begining when there is no content, add a 'add entry' button.  when this button is clicked, open
another modal window using ajax that contains widgets for the user to enter information and a save button and cancel button.  the widgets on this window should be for:
application id, application title, release date, price and game logo. for the game logo allow the user to upload a new image to 'images\storefront\apps\<appid>\<appid>-<unique hash>.<ext>' 
or add an javascript image selector that reads from the 'images\storefront\apps\<appid>\' directory and shows all the images the user can select.  
when the user is done adding or editing the information, if they hit cancel the modal closes and nothing changes.  if the user hits save, it will use ajax to add the entry to the database
then close the modal so the user can go back to the tabbed section editor modal, this modal will use ajax and show the new entry  the same way the included image shows it. (descibe it in the prompt as i cannot include the image in my prompt).
the 'add entry' button should now be below the new entry.

allow the user  to add as many entry rows as they would like per tab.  but it is a single column of entries.
users can add up to 4 tabs maximum, the '+' button should disapear after the 4th tab.
add a small 'x' to the top right corner of each tab, which when clciked will remove the tab and any content associated with that tab.

the bottom of the tab editor modal should have a save button and a cancel button. the cancel button closes the modal and doesnt save any changes.
the save button will save the tab information ensuring that all tabs have the same group id so the user can add multiple capsules with different tabs,
 the individual row/entry information about the games that are added to the tab, make sure to have a groupid column so the correct entry shows up on the correct tab.

the whole thing should use ajax to avoid a full webpage refresh.  use any librarys needed
---------------------------------------


analyze the clientside functions using the MCP tool; search for functions with these words in their names: `VIP`, `paypal`, `purchase`, `guest`, `gift`, `license`, `receipt` . then analyze the python server code related to purchasing, receipts, guestpasses, gift passes and more; within the steam3 folder. 
create a comprehensive plan to implement any missing functions/packets/code and go through each method related to the things i mentioned earlier and double check for mistakes, make sure the methods return everything in a format the client needs.
your plan should then include information about what still needs to be wired up, or connected via calls or reference so everything works in a cohesive manner.
--------------------------------------------
using 'archived_steampowered/2005/v2/index.html' replace the latest news content area with the correct latest news tag that displays the news in the same format that the archived html does.
then
----------------------
i want to de-clutter the admin sidebar by moving parents to different parents so it is a nested dropdown.  also remove the 'toggle submenu' text. so follow these instructions: 
- under FAQ management, move FAQ and FAQ Categories to a new nested parent within  'Support & FAQ Management' labeled 'FAQ Management' which drops down to the FAQ and FAQ categories links.
- fix the troubleshooter link under 'Support & FAQ Management' so it is a dropdown again with 'troubleshooter management' and 'requests viewer' underneath 'troublershooter' which is under the parent 'Support & FAQ Management'.
- add the support page link under the 'Support & FAQ Management' parent. 
- create another new parent link labeled 'Content Management' which will contain these links and nested dropdown parents: Custom Pages, Error Page, Custom Titles, Page Version Management and Scheduled Content.
- create another new parent link labeled 'Storefront Management' which will contain these links: 2004/2005 Storefront Management and  Storefront.
- then make sure any links/parents that have been moved are no longer on the root of the sidebar and are displayed under their respective parents.
remember, it must supported nested dropdowns.

-------------------------
- revert all changes made to ' sidebar_section_variants' and to the files `themes/2006_v1/sql/settings.sql` 
 and `themes/2006_v2/sql/settings.sql`
- in install_sidebar_sections.sql and any php code that uses the tables from install_sidebar_sections.sql make the following changes:
- remove the columns sort_order, is collapsible, collapsible_id, icon_path and has_icicles from the 'sidebar_sections' table, but keep the values for each column removed as they will be moved to the sidebar_section_variants table for their respective entrys.
- add a new column 'sidebar_name' which will be the name used as the parameter in the twig tag 'sidebar_section'.
- add the columns variant_id (unique, index, auto generate), sort_order, is collapsible, collapsible_id, icon_path and has_icicles to 'sidebar_section_variants', insert the data that was removed from sidebar_sections into the correct variants entries.
- create a new table called 'sidebar_section_entries' which will contain the individual entries that are placed within a specific section.
-- the table must have these columns: entry_id (unique, index, auto generate), parent_variant_id, entry_order, entry_content (html)
- then parse the links from each section in the 2006_v2 index.html and 2006_v1 index.html and add the entries to the 'sidebar_section_entries' table which  connects to the correct `sidebar_section_variants` id.
---------------------------

fix 'cms/admin/storefront_product.php'.
- turn the edit link into a button
- add a delete button for each entry, use ajax when the user clicks the button to prevent full page refreshing.
- change the edit button to instead open a large modal with all the widgets (pre-filled with the selected entrys information) and the save and cancel button. it must use ajax for saving to prevent full page refreshing.
- fix the image paths so they load from the '<cms root>/storefront/images/' directory and not '/cms/' or /cms/admini/'.
- create a new button with the label 'Add Product' which will use the same modal as the edit modal, but it will be used to create a new entry.  use ajax for opening the modal and saving the information to prevent full page refreshes.
- change the image upload buttons so they open a little modal with 2 buttons labeled 'Upload Image' and 'Choose Existing Image'.  the upload image button uses the normal file uploading stuff but the choose existing image button should open another modal which will display all the images that are currently in the same directory that image uploads are held in, it should show each as a preview image.  let the user click an image to select it and click save to set that as the image.  use a premade js library to deal with pre-existing image selection.
-- use ajax to save the selected image and update the preview on the main modal to prevent page refreshes.
--------------------
1. go through and analyze the template engine and try to gather all the different tags that it renders/parses.     │
│   then update the readme.md and TAGS.md with any missing tags or information.  all added information must be very    │
│   descriptive with any valid parameters, what each parameter does, whether a tag is specific to a theme, a           │
│   description of what the tag does/renders and anything else that may prove to be important to anyone looking to     │
│   create a new template or custom page in the CMS. 2. paginate the table on 'cms/admin/error_log.php' so it has a    │
│   next and previous button and page number links in between.  it should only show a maximum of 30 entries per page.  │
│   3. add a notification icon to the top header bar of the admin_v2 and admin_default themes that shows a small       │
│   floating   
--------------------
│ > analyze every php script within 'cms/' and subdirectories to find all coding issues, syntax issues, incomplete     │
│   code, fixme or todo comments/placeholders or anything else that ma be an issues. then create                       │

in the visibility section, give each download entry a dropdown for location, a dropdown for render type, a dropdown for mirror link type and keep the check boxes there 
for hiding and displaying downloads.
the selections for the location downdown depend on the page version and theme:
*for 2003_v2 theme:
- version 1 download page, hide the location drop down as there is only the main content area.

the selections for render type are: 'download image button', 'Single Link' and 'Title W/Mirrors'.

 (uses the text_styler.php in cms/utils/)

download page display options:

--------------------------------


want the management panel and db tables to be as clean and intuitive and customizable as they can be without being complicated. i am thinking of a grid sort of system, depending on the theme and current download page version selected, it lets you select the location (if there is more than one) and then select the render type (depending on location) and whether the entry is visible for each download. give me atleast 3 ideas for the admin page so managing different versions of the same page within these constraints will be simple. this is the only constraint i am working with: 1. the page versions which contain the floating box location can only contain these download render types: 'single link' or 'title (no size) w/ mirrors as links'. these are all the options available:
- available render types:
---title (with size) w/ mirrors as buttons
---title (with size) w/ mirrors as links
---title (no size) w/ mirrors as links
--- mirrors as buttons w/o title  (only default (NON-FULL) steam install mirrors)
---single button
---single link
--- title w/ single link with size next to link as text

- available downloads:
--- default steam installer
--- full steam installer
--- all full game steam installers
--- windows hlds update tool
--- linux hlds update tool
--- dedicated server (windows)
--- dedicated server (linux)
these are the different version download pages with the information they hold by default when the cms is installed:
2003_v2 theme:

# download page version 1:
- available locations: main content only
- render type: 	title (with size) w/ mirrors as buttons
- downloads:  	full steam installer, all full game steam installers

# download page version 2:
- available locations: main content only
- render type:	mirrors as buttons w/o title (default steam install mirrors)
- downloads:	default steam install mirrors

# download page version 3:
- available locations: main content only
- render type:	title (with size) w/ mirrors as links
- downloads:	default steam installer, full steam installer, all full game steam installers, dedicated server (windows), dedicated server (linux)




2004 theme:

# download page version 1:
- available locations: main content only
- render type: 	 title w/ single link with size next to link as text, title (with size) w/ mirrors as links
- downloads:  	default steam installer [title w/ single link with size next to link as text], dedicated server (windows) [title with mirrors as links], dedicated server (linux) [title with mirrors as links]

# download page version 2:
- available locations: main content, floating box
- render type:	single button, mirrors as buttons w/o title (default steam install mirrors)
- downloads:	default steam install mirrors [single button]{main content}, dedicated server (windows) [title with mirrors as links]{floating box}, dedicated server (linux) [title with mirrors as links] {floating box}

# download page version 3:
- available locations: main content, floating box
- render type:	single button, mirrors as buttons w/o title (default steam install mirrors)
- downloads:	default steam install mirrors [single button]{main content}, wind

----------------------------------
#1.) create all the twig templates and move all the css, js and image assets to the correct folders in the 2005_v2 theme.  currently onlt the index renders correctly.
the storefront is 100% missing, it displays the header and footer only, the news pages and many others have a header and footer but is not themed.

#2.) fix news rendering on news.php.  in 2004 the news article contents on the main news.php page (not in a individual article) the contents of each news article has html tags visible when it is supposed to actually render the html in the article.
iin 2005_v1 and above, the news.php page displays no news at all.

#3.) fix the storefront for 2006_v1 and above.  the storefront does not display the capsules at all, every page in the storefront shows the theme but no actual content other than the header and sidebar with links.

#4.) fix the template engine navbar.css over ride.  it is supposed to FULLY any rules in the main navbar.css that are found within a themes 'css\navbar.css'. right now it keeps the original rule (globalheadbar_logo for example) and the override which causes the override to not do anything.

#5.) make these changes to the download management system (cms/admin/download_settings.php / cms/admin/download_files.php) and download rendering system (getsteamnow.php):
1. remove 'File Visibility by Version' table and save button from cms/admin/download_files.php. also remove the associated database table for visibility.
2. put a dropdown box at the top of cms/admin/download_files.php which has entries for each page version available in the current theme.  display the default when the page first loads. when the user changes the selection, use ajax to reload the download file management settings from the database without refreshing the entire page.
3. add 2 new columns to the download file management table labeled 'Visible' and 'Rendering'.
4. Each download will have a checkbox within the 'Visible' cell for hiding the download on the getsteamnow.php page.
5. each download entry will have a dropdown in the 'Rendering' column cell which depends on the available options for the specific current theme and page version selected:
a. make these render options available:
- title (with size) w/ mirrors as buttons
- title (with size) w/ mirrors as links
- title (no size) w/ mirrors as links
- mirrors as buttons w/o title
- single button
- single link
- title w/ single link with size next to link as text
- floating box single link
- floating box title (no size) w/ mirrors as links

b. these are the render option constraints depending on the theme and page version: 
- 2003_v2 v1, v2 and v3  and 2004 v1, v2 and v3 can have all render types except 'floating box single link' and 'floating box title (no size) w/ mirrors as links'  in the main content area available to them.
- 2004 v2 and v3 also have the 'floating box' location available to them.
-- the floating box can only contain these render types: 'single link' and 'title (no size) w/ mirrors as links', so add those two to the dropdown when the 2004 v2 or v3 pages are selected.

6. allow the downloads to be re-ordered by dragging/dropping using a javascript library.
7. design the necessary database tables for these changes.
8. all of the render options can be viewed between all 6 archived 2003_v2 and 2004 getsteamnow page versions:
a 'archived_steampowered\2003\v2\'
- getsteamnow_v1.html
- getsteamnow_v2.html
- getsteamnow_v3.html
b. 'archived_steampowered\2004\'
- getsteamnow_v1.html
- getsteamnow_v2.html
- getsteamnow_v3.html

9. for the single button, use this function to create the button image: 'renderGetSteamNowButton' which is found in the file 'cms\utilities\text_styler.php'.
10. keep everything else the same, such as the edit/delete buttons and modal when editing a download.

add the following important information into agents.md in a structured and categorized way and then output the full agents.md with the additions and changes, then also create a CLAUDE.md that is target and structured specifically for anthropics claude ai LLM:
1. the template engine automatically changes image `src`, css style 'src' and javascript paths to the themes directory depending on the asset type.  
for example: if the currently active theme is `2004` and a template or custom page has html like this: 
```html
<img border="0" src="logo_steam_header.jpg" alt="[Valve]" height="54" width="152">
```
it will automatically rewrite the `src` path, the html turns into:
```html
<img border="0" src="/2004_cms/themes/2006_v1/images/logo_steam_header.jpg" alt="[Valve]" height="54" width="152">
```

1 a. if an asset is used in multiple themes, the template engine path rewriting can be overridden by adding a period and forward slash before the path.  for example, if the image
`blackdot.gif` is used between 3  or more themes, instead of copying it to every theme's `images` folder; the html path can be forced so the image is loaded from `<cms root>/images/`.
 forced path image html:
```html
<img border="0" src="./images/blackdot.gif" alt="" height="50" width="125">
```

1 b. always remove any folders from image  paths if they use `img` or `image` folders.

2. the template_engine.php is built in a way that hard-codes some of the functionality that is specific to some themes.  always be mindful of the different themes when making changes.

3.  the admin panel pages which contain content that can be added or edited should ALWAYS open a MODAL for adding and editing and ALWAYS use ajax for saving, removing or adding entries/content to prevent full page refreshing.  
- The modal must close when the user clicks outside of the modal.
- Always put a translucent dark overlay behind the modal, covering the webpage to make the modal look focused.
- tables should ALWAYS be paginated with a next button and previous button, with page number links in between.  the page numbers that are visible should be the previous 5 pages followed by `...` which is followed by the last 5 pages.

4, when a page contains a way to upload an image, use a public javascript library with ajax support, so the admin can select an image already present on the server using preview based picking (no drop downs, lists, etc.. it should show previews of all the images) with the option to upload a new image if one doesnt exist that is needed.

5. any areas that require selecting/setting an image must show a small preview of the current image.

6. if a request requires a change to the admin themes, always edit ALL admin themes in the same way to ensure they all work the same way.

7. amy content loaded from the database that contains a column for `order` should have drag and drop re-ordering built in with ajax so the admin can easily re-order content.

8. cms back-end related code should always go in the `/cms/` and `cms/admin/` directories.

9. third-party assets, libraries and fonts should be place within `/includes/` directory.

10. all content editing text boxes should be full WYSIWYG boxes.

general information about the different CMS themes:
1. 2002_v1, 2002_v2 and 2003_v1 do not get a header bar.
2. 2002 through 2005_v2 themes do not contain sidebars with the exception of the 2005_v2 storefront.
3. 2006_v2 and above are pure storefront websites, meaning that the index page for those themes is the storefront index.

------


add these to agents.md and claude.md:
1. NEVER refer to images or any other assets within the `archived_steampowered/` folder.

------------------
file:///F:/development/steam/emulator_v2/files/webroot/2004_cms/archived_steampowered/storefront/v2/index.php?area=search&l=&s=&i=&a=

continue with the previous task while remembering to use the correct template_engine tags. the home/index
  page does not display the 5 capsule images which are stored in the database.  ensure 2006_v1 uses the same
  storefront as 2005_v2. the index page should be used for displaying the other pages in the storefront, for
  example if the user clicks `search` on the sidebar, the url would be
  `<domain>/storefront/index.php?area=search&l=&s=&i=&a=`.
-----------------
 - the storefront index page for 2005_v2 and 2006_v2 shows the 'browse games' page instead of the page that
  shows the 5 capsule images which are grabbed from the database and loaded from the
  storefront/images/capsules/(top,middle,bottom_right,bottom_left) folder.  this is how the index is supposed
  to look `file:///F:/development/steam/emulator_v2/files/webroot/2004_cms/archived_steampowered/2005/storefron
  t/index.html`.
  - the sidebar on all of the pages is not spaced correctly, it is too close to the content area.
  - the storefront itself is too far down the page in 2005_v2, it should be located in the same area as the
  archived index.html page i mentioned earlier.
  - when clicking a game, i get the error 'app not found'.
  - the all games link tries to go to `allgames.php` it should be `all.php` aka `index.php?area=all`.
  - fix the template_engine.php so the links in the header and footer lead to urls that are in the cms root
  directory. currently, the buttons such as getsteamnow lead to
  `http://192.168.3.180/2004_cms/storefront/index.php?area=getsteamnow` but it is supposed to be
  `http://192.168.3.180/2004_cms/index.php?area=getsteamnow`.

----------------------
edit the storefront search.php page so when browse=1 is set in GET variables, the search box will be invisible, the content title will display 'Browse Games' and under the content title and 
background image there will be this text before the product table '}} Browsing games in category: <product catagory>'.  for example if the catagory selected from the main browse games
page was 'New releases' the text under the content header would display `}} Browsing games in category: New releases`.  the page should match this exactly in format, make sure to 
color the two '}}` red like in the example as well: F:\development\steam\emulator_v2\files\webroot\2004_cms\archived_steampowered\2005\storefront\v2\browse_new_releases.html

-----------------
- using this archived pages html, `F:/development/steam/emulator_v2/files/webroot/2004_cms/archived_steampowe  │
│   red/2005/storefront/product_page_with_discount.html`, if a product page is to be rendered with the metascore   │
│   product page twig file and the product is unreleeased/prerelease, place the following html over the            │
│   metacritic score area: `<table background="img/apps/metaCriticSpace.jpg" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"       │
│   height="40" width="600">                                                                                       │

│   - for all purchase types on an application/games product page, allow the admin to add a discount to the        │
│   purchase.  the page `product_page_with_discount.html` shows `Pre-order Discount- $2.00` underneath the price   │
│   on the next line, this is exactly how discounts should appear.                                                 │
│   - for all product page templates allow the administrator to add any html they want OVER the content header     │
│   background area,  examples can be found on `product_page_with_discount.html` for pages with metacritic bars    │
│   and `product_page_normal.html` for the other pages.                                                            │
│   - create a new mariadb table inside install.php that will hold the following columns: id (auto generated,      │
│   index, unique, integer), appid (integer), purchase_type (string, can be 'preload' or 'normal'), theme_list     │
│   (comma seperated list of themes this will show up on), content (html that will be displayed over the top of    │
│   the product's content header background image).                                                                │
│   - for each admin product management page for the storefront (not the 2004/2005 legacy storefront) add a        │
│   section for discounts.  this will display all the different package and single product 'purchase' sections     │
│   that this product  will render to the public along with a text box with a label for entering a discount which  │
│   will then display the information using the same information on the page `product_page_with_discount.html`.    │
│   you will need to create a new table to handle the discount information and then pull from it during rendering  │
│   if it exists.                                                                                                  │
│   - add these columns to the store_apps table in install.php and update `/sql/install_storefront.sql` as well;   │
│   columns: release_date (date), product_type (string, allowed: video, demo, game, thirdparty, other),            │
│   genre_list (comma seperated string, allowed values: action, strategy, RPG, casual, misc), forum_url (string),  │
│   friends_enabled (bool), vac_enabled (bool), with_sdk (bool), hdr_enabled (bool),  languages (string),          │
│   publisher_id (int, linked to store_developers table).                                                          │
│   - create a new column for the store_developers table in install.php and update `/sql/install_storefront.sql`   │
│   entries with the new column as well.  the column to add is `developer_website`. 
----------------------
 do a fully analysis of the entire CMS and take thorough notes about the template_engine, functions found in
  the files within `/cms/` and everything else and store it in your memory for this project.  limit yourself to
  the root cms directory and cms, includes, sql, plugins, storefront and themes directorys only.
---------------------


this rip all of the information for each product within the product table from 
https://web.archive.org/web/20071008164033/http://storefront.steampowered.com/v2/index.php?area=all&sort_by=Metascore&sort_last=Name&sort_order=ASC&l=English&cc=US. 
grab the product title name, appid from the table entry url, download the game entry image and price. go through all the pages until you are complete. 
then open each product page up and grab the following information from the products page: 
game appid, game title, video trailer appid (if present), media + links urls (there can be multiple, add type of link that it is (forum, media, etc...)),meta score, metascore url (critic review link),
 all information under the 'GAME DETAILS' sidebar header (title, developer, publisher, release date, languages, categorys, options, game rating, etc...), 
system requirements (minimum and recommended), 'ABOUT THE GAME' description if present, screenshot file names and background header image file name.
